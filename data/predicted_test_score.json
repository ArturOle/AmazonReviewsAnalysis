The external LED isn't even mentioned in the user's manual. It's there purely for decoration, apparently. The software on the phone is of a generally clunky quality. I can get to the Ringtones shop in one click, but if I miss a call, it's 3 or 4 clicks to check for the caller's identity. You can see where Cingular's priorities are...The one mitigating factor I'll mention is that the reception has improved greatly since I installed the new antenna that I was sent by Cingular.Next time, I'm buying a Nokia or a Samsung.",

It is easy to move from menu to menu by pressing the shown number (or scroll around and press select if you want).-Some useful functions are hidden away under three menu levels (ie Calculator, Alarm, Calendar). There is no way to assign a shortcut. There are built-in shortcuts to internet, text messaging, contacts, instant messaging.-It is easy to put the phone to vibrate, even without opening it.-The light on the outside lights red if there is a waiting message (voice or text) but not when you have missed calls.-You cannot use most of the phone's functions when talking on the phone. (ie you cannot play games if you have a headset and are having a boring conversation.) But you can take a 'note' and later save it as a phone number.-The phone can only &quot;ring and vibrate&quot; at the highest volume.-The volume control for the games is tied to the volume of the ringer. So if you lower the volume while playing and forget to increase it afterward, the ringer will be quiet. Also, if the phone is set to loudest ring, some menu confirmation will elicit a loud sound from the phone (ie entering a new contact.) This is annoying.",

    "text": "Alas, my trusty Nokia cell phone died horribly and slowly, the folks at the cell phone store had to put it out of its misery. Having driven there through traffic and rain, I was surprised to find my options for a replacement limited, especially since my now dead Nokia had lasted just slightly longer than its warranty.I left with a nifty little (slightly) used LG 1300 as the replacement and decided to let a month go by and see what I thought. At this point, the pros outweigh the cons, but, one person's pro might be another's con and vice versa. Human nature being what it is, I think it is more fun to focus on the cons first.First the battery life is short, and the claim that this phone has up to 240 minutes of standby is debatable. There should be some sort of way to shake this thing around and generate a bit more time. Better yet, if one could hop violently from side to side as though afflicted with St. Vitus' Dance (which is a self-limiting disorder of movement caused by both streptococcal infection and by talking loudly on cell phones in crowded venues) and recharge the battery, then that would be very entertaining to watch.Next, this phone is so small that it could be confused with a big pack of chewing gum. This feature is bad only if you keep a cluttered desk or satchel and keep having to call your cell phone from your desk phone in order to locate the little gizmo. The washing machine poses another, perhaps lethal set of consequences that could stem from the size of this phone.We need to talk about the buzzer/vibrate setting, a feat of malicious engineering that deserves Cingular----I meant singular----mention. A pair of nondescript, tiny buttons grace the left side of the LG 1300. These buttons magically change the phone's setting from vibrate, silent, or ring if you accidentally press them. So when the phone rings, it's best to poke it with a stick first, then flip it open from the junction of the bottom/top not the sides.(Permit me a parenthetical word about the buzzing or vibrating here. If you have a small chassis from a toy car available, you set the LG 1300 to vibrate, attach it to the chassis with a rubber band, put it on tray or cutting board and presto, you have a dynamic cat toy! Just call your number from another phone and your felines will pounce all over this sleek, mouse-like marvel.)I was surprised at the poor selection of ring tones---or is it spelled solid as ringtones?---available, but then I found that the initial menu pick on the phone takes one to a media mall. I haven't visited there yet, but if I'm ever hungry I may try out the food court.There are good things about this phone. The buttons sort of click when you press them, which makes it seem like you are entering data into one of those tricoders from the any of the various Star Trek series. Using the menus is pretty intuitive (unlike say those in a French restaurant), and changing the settings requires minimal effort.Once flipped open, the earpiece and mouthpiece are sort of in the vicinity of the human ear and mouth, respectively, which does make a degree of sense in the design of a telephone! Plus this phone does not have a camera!! It's bad enough to have to talk to some of my friends, but if I also had to look at them, I would never use the phone.I've also had some trouble with calls being dropped, and if this is happening because of some undocumented feature in the user manual, then I would like to know what it is. To me, this is not necessarily a bad thing because there is simply no better way to get out of an uncomfortable or unwanted conversation than to hang up on yourself.The sleek, curved, compact case makes one feel a bit like a spy, so the coolness factor should not be discounted entirely. And the designers even included this wild little mirror on the outside. Although this tiny mirror gets smudged quite a bit, who knows, it could someday save your life if you are ever stranded and need to attract the attention of any would-be rescuers once your phone's battery has died.Postscript",

I paid $50 for the LG C1300 phone. I was assured by the salesperson that the LG brand, although new, was in their experience performing well. This phone has only a fraction of the features my 2 year older model Nokia had, the signal is worse than any I've ever had and the phone is not very user friendly. Now unless I pay full price won't be able to upgrade again for 2 years and am stuck with junk. BUYER BE WARE! DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!",

Which is just SNAKE with a different name. It says you can go on the different types of instant messangers, use the internet, and download different graphics, tones & games. but that is not true. every time i go to use any of them .. it always say GPRS not found. i have no clue waht that means, but i guess prepaid versions were ripped off with the choice of internet and pretty much all fun, if any, with this fone. This fone has good quality ringers, only 1 or 2 good backrounds. HORRIBLE reception. every time i try calling my friends out on my bike or something, i have to jam the fone up to my ear just to hear them. it has vibrate which is good for when im in class, because my parents always tell me to turn off my fone is school, but when you turn it off, if anyone calls, you wont be able to see missed calls if its turned off so i just keep it on.it has .. i think 20 ringtones. theyre ok. it has speed dial. but no voice dial and no voice recorder :( also no speaker :(it does have 255 fone book entries available and i think it has like 3 way calling and call waiting so thts ok. so yeh i guess i wood reccommend this fone .. but now let me recap all the things this fone dont have SPEAKERFONE, VOICE DIALING, VOICE RECORDER, INTERNET, RINGTONE,GRAPHIC,GAME AND MULTIMEDIA DOWNLOAD, CAMERA, VIDEO CAMERA, ughh i dont know why i even got this fone but yeah thats all the things it doesnt have so there ya go. and if you want good reception, dont get this fone !!",

    "text": "This phone is worthless. I have now had it for 3 years and felt I may as well give my input in case anyone else was considering buying it since I am researching a new phone. Here are my main issues with this phone:- The User Interface is horrid. I am a web developer and usability engineer so I can state that as a fact. The UI on Nokias is 10x better. The fact that I still hate the UI after 3 years should really tell you something. This issue alone is 90% of the reason I hate this phone.- Dropped calls. Poor reception. Once again nothing like my old Nokias (which were all free Cingular phones.) I also have the antenna \"upgrade\". Made no difference AT ALL.- Side volume controls. I used to always want a phone with convenient volume controls on the side until I got this. If it is in your pocket (or purse if you are female) you will find the buttons get hit all the time and will turn your vibrate on and off and make your phone beep. Obviously this problem isnt specific to this phone but it is something to consider in cellphone design.On the plus side, the phone is generally always reliable. The volume is decent. The speaker has held up better over time than my Nokias did (they had noticable volume degradation over time).Also, it wasn't until recently until the battery starting having problems holding a decent charge. I got in a solid 2 years of good battery/charger performance. Definately long enough to wait out your contract and get a new phone.",

The lack of a speakerphone setting really annoys me, I'll admit, and so does the lack of a camera phone, but those weren't common features back in 2004. The vanity mirror is kind silly, but I have to admit that has been very useful to me over the years. (Which isn't to say a display in its place wouldn't have been more useful, but at least a mirror isn't totally useless to carry around.)Some people have said they have problems with reception using this phone. This has never been a problem for me, but the coverage area could have something to do with that. I actually get better coverage with this phone than most of my AT&T; friends do on their newer devices.After three years of use, I'm retiring this phone for an updated, unlocked phone. It has been dropped, rained on (heavily,) and even thrown long distances, but it still works fine to this day. A sick, girly, self-absorbed part of me is thinking, \"What am I going to do now that my cell phone doesn't have a vanity mirror?\" (Another part of me is psyched to finally have a camera-phone.)",

I had a problem with the voicemail so I called their service number and waited 30 min just to speak to someone and they didn't even fix the problem. And they were charging me minutes to talk to them. My husband is military and we moved to Germany, so we canceled the service before our contract was up. Now Cingular wants the phones, manuals, chargers and box back or they will charge us $250 each phone which is outragous. I of course don't have the box or manual. This phone and cingular are not worth the trouble and expense.",

Also, I've only had it for one week and I have Cingular service.My initial thoughts are that this Treo 600 is wonderful. As a phone, it works great. Speakerphone is clear and loud, as is standard mode. The camera is so-so, which doesn't bother me since I really didn't get it for the camera. I can surf the web, which is nice but slow. But the PDA part is where this device really shines. I have it hooked up to receive my work e-mail, which is fantastic. I can send and receive e-mail without needing my laptop. This alone gives this device 5 stars. I imagine the Treo 600 does most things my Ipaq did, but I'll have to wait and see.Pros:E-mail is downloadable.Small and compact.Speakerphone.Sound is great.Cons:Keyboard is kinda small, but I'm getting used to it.Web browsing is slow.

    "text": "Well, as an early adapter, I guess I should be used to taking it hard. I bought Verizon's PalmOne Treo 600 the first day it came out - over a year after Cingular released it. My plan is 400 anytime minutes, unlimited in-network calling, unlimited nights and weekend, and $5 for Internet access a month. Unless I go over, it should cost me $49.95 a month. I just got my first bill.$1,641.66.It turns out that the connection to the Internet doesn't shut off - even if you chose \"Disconnect\" from the web browser's menu. Even if you turn off the unit. It continues to ping the Internet looking for data every six minutes. Hence my bill show some 1023-minute calls.Steve in Verizon's data division said they've received a lot of calls on this issue and isn't sure why they even offer the $5 web-only feature, when customers need to get the $49.95/month unlimited data transfer or deal with $1,000-plus monthly bills. When I asked if there was a way to stop the pinging every six minutes, I was told no, \"it's a data phone first and a cell phone second.\"Interesting, as my friends who have the phone with other carriers have never had this problem. Interesting, as I was never told this when I bought it. All I wanted was a freakin' cell/PDA combo, so I don't have to carry both with me, making me look like I'm sporting a chubby in two pockets at once. With Verizon, the cost for doing so is $44.95 plus your calling plan a month, which for me will come to about $100.After 58 minutes, I was told my bill should be adjusted within 24 to 48 hours.Also, on Verizon Wireless's PalmOne Treo 600 Smartphone web page it lists a 5 MB transfer for only $24.95. When I asked the technical rep about that option, he said getting it would still cause a Treo 600 owner's bill to be over $1,000 a month. He said it was up there for use with other phones. He had no answer when I said there are no other phones on that page.Now, I probably could return the Treo 600 - except I already sold my old phone and Palm on eBay.Of course, if I could just get a free minute for every time I heard \"Oh, that's the new phone. I'm not familiar with it\" none of this would be an issue.Buy the phone from Cingular and don't deal with the problems I had with Verizon Wireless. It is a great product for all the reasons listed in the other reviews.",

I chose Cinglar as the rebate on amazon brought the phone to an OK $299, and given well see a newer phone soon not bad. However HUGE issues with the CINGULAR/AMAZON system - 10 days not resolved.

It buzzes, it crackles, and it keeps doing so after every conceivable kind of reset, even the \"last resort\" battery disconnect reset.I haven't had these problems with my Treo 650...and I hope I won't, because the support situation appears dismal; a not insubstantial charge for any phone support over the first 90 days, a warranty of only a year, and reports online of people who have gone through several Treo 600s in a row.Incidentally, after around 35 minutes on hold waiting for PalmOne, I got disconnected. Their sales department answers right away, though. And PalmOne wonders why its market share keeps slipping? It's about the service. And you won't find it here.

But I do get good signal inside buildings and even in basement at work so I put up with the loss connections problems.Then my friends and family starting to tell me that they hear interferences and loud, buzzing noise when I called them on the Treo from.

I have used the T-Mobile Sidekick, the AT&T; Motorola MPX, a Nextel Blackberry, a Samsung i600, and even an older style Treo in the form of the Treo 300. And out of every smart device I have ever used, the Treo 600 and 650 are 1000 times better then any of them!1# The Treo's have large color screens with full keyboards, but are still small enough to fit in your pocket.2# The battery life is insanely long! Both of the new Treo's claim four to five hours talk time, I have found even longer. I often lay in my bed at night surfing the web for hours and hours, and by the time I am ready to go to sleep, my Treo 600 and 650 still have enough battery life to go a few more rounds.3# Because the Treo's are so popular the prices for accessories, software, add-on's, ect are Much cheaper then those for the other types of smart devices on the market. There is even talk by Palmone to start using Linux as the Palmsource software core, so there will be even more software available. And because Linux is open source, the phones will eventually be cheaper then those running the Microsoft Pocket PC. With the added bonus of the dependability of Linux!4# Because the Treo's are of the Candy-Bar style design, they are much easier to talk on. Because there is no flip, or antenna to fumble with.5# There is a software lancher called \"ZLauncher\" which has many features for your Treo's software interface. One of which allows you to see the exact level of signal strength. By using this tool you can so how much better the Treo's antenna and related components work, compared to any other phone on the market. I get a great signal with Sprint, but with Sprint and my Treo, my service is even better! I get signals with my Treo in places where my Sanyo and LG did not. In fact, I get better signal strength with my Treo, then my friends get with their phones!6# Palmone has a patent on a new design of smart device that they are working to bring to the market. A design nothing like the designs currently available. A PDA phone that will be thinner and still able to have a large full color screen and keyboard. SO the next generation of Treo's will be even better!The only downfall to the Palmone Treo's today, is price. That is because they are still new to the PDA phone market. Once they start making more and more phones, the prices will come down. And once they restructure their PDA manufacturing and company purpose in general, the prices will come down. I don't normally write reviews on phones, because I used to be a Die-Hard Motorola phone fan, and I guess still am. But if Palmone keeps making phones this perfect, then I will only buy their phones for the rest of my life! I can not say enough good things about these phones! Try one and see what I am talking about. Use it with Sprint PCS's $10 unlimited Visions access!Russell",

I'd still be carrying mine except for an unfortunate incident with a washing machine. This phone, the 4920, follows up and improves upon that tradition.The reception is just as good as the 4900, and the battery life, if anything, is better. The USB cable I bought at Radio Shack still allows me access to the Internet from my Powerbook, and I can still use my old chargers.In addition, the phone is slightly smaller, and the new screen and GUI is much prettier with more vibrant and lifelike colors. Navigation is faster, web browsing is faster, and it's packed with nice little features like showing the state of origin of an incoming call.So, if you are a 4900 user like me, and are worried about ever getting a better phone, and don't need it to take pictures or other non-phone nonsense, then this is your next phone.Update",

    "text": "I got this phone for free by switching to Sprint, but I think I'm going to stray away from any phone that has this particular user interface firmware in the future.First the good:+Battery life for the phone is pretty nice, lasting about three days from a full charge with moderate use.+I've had no problems with signal reception at all with this phone. The signal will work just fine whether I'm inside an elevator or making a call from inside an airplane after it has landed.+The display is very clear and easy to see in dark places+The user interface is nicely menu-driven, which means you don't have to remember how to use the phone as the instructions are always on screen. This does make navigation more cumbersome as you wade through menues instead of use quick key combos, but overall, it makes this an ideal phone for those who are not inclined to memorize hotkeys on their phones.Now the bad:-The speaker phone is a great feature, but the sound quality of the speaker is pretty bad to the point that I end up not using the speaker phone at times because I can't make out what the other side is saying. Also, it seems that this same hardware is used for the non-speaker funcationality as well, so sometimes, I have to ask the other person to back away from their phone and speak in a softer voice so that the sound from their voice doesn't saturate the speakers and become an unintelligible mess of squared sounds with a capped off amplitude. Turning down the speaker output doesn't exactly help with this. I've never had these speaker issues with other phones. Getting an earpiece for the phone will solve this problem, completely.-The user interface for unlocking the phone is annoying. To unlock the phone, you must hold the BACK button for one full second. Not a big deal, but I just came off a phone that allows you to unlock the phone with a specific keypress combination, which gets me to dialing faster. In this case, you must press the BACK button once to wake the phone up from sleep mode, and then hold BACK again to initiate the unlocking of the phone so you can dial numbers.-Pressing a button on the phone while the keys are locked does not light up the keypad, so it requires some memory and touch sensitivity to find that BACK button in the darkness.-Here's the kicker, HOLDING DOWN THE 9 KEY WHILE LOCKED WILL CALL 911 REGUARDLESS OF WHETHER THE KEYS ARE LOCKED OR NOT. This is a biggie. I keep the phone in the pocket of my jeans, and I've had the phone call 911 twice from within my pocket, even though the keys were locked. I'm not sure what the dispatcher hears when \"my pocket\" calls 911, but I can only assume that they are not amused.The other features of this phone, like ReadyLink and Internet Downloads, were services that I turned off as soon as I could. I just didn't have any real uses for those kinds of frills.",

Unlike the RL2000, the 4920 truly lacks the reception and battery life of the RL2000. I've always been a fan of the \"candy bar\" style phones for their better reception than the \"flip phones\", but the 4920 fails in reception in my area. Some of the newer features are nice; ringtones, screensavers, and smaller size, but nothing is worth the comprimise of dropped calls. Do Not use this phone if it going to be used as a business line; you may be out of business soon. Based on research, candy bar phones have better reception than flip phones, but don't bet your money on this one. FIND A Sanyo RL2000 PCS Vision Ready Link Phone. It may be a bit bulky, but the battery life is enormous and the reception is unsurpassed by other phones I've tested.",

The bad thing about it is that the jack for an ear piece stops working after about one month of regular use. I have gone through three of these phones, and am finally just getting rid of it. The third one stopped working two days after I received it. Two of the phones I've been through also had a few buttons stop working (the back button and the right arrow button). I'm not the only one with this problem, either. Evidently this happens frequently according to a rep I talked to at a Sprint Store. I am not happy with this phone at all.",

    "text": "This is a decent case. The leather is nice and overall it's decent quality.Pros:It holds your phone pretty securely with the top fold over flap.Cons:- Uses a button snap to close instead of the magnetic snap that most other cases of this style use.- It COMPLETELY covers the ringer port on the back of the phone, making it very hard to hear the phone ringing in a noisy public setting. I've already missed several calls because of this.- The hole for the audio/hands free jack is cut out, but instead of leaving an opening from the top of the case to where the jack would be with the phone in the case, It's just a hole that's the actual size of the opening. This matters since you can't put the phone in and out of the case with headphones/headset connected.- Phone position in the case is awkward for right handers. If the phone is on your right hand side, you must put the phone in the case with the antenna pointing behind you with the screen facing in towards you. This makes you have to flip the phone upside down in your hand as you reach to your side to put it in the case. How many times do you think you can do this before you fumble and drop it?",

    "text": "I was having a really tough time finding a case to fit my i580, and just a bit of advice, DO NOT go through Nextel and pay $29.99 or more for any of their cases that claim they fit the i580! I ordered 3 before I realized they do not fit because number 1, the i580 is too thick for these cases, and number 2, they do not have the right openings for the i580's buttons so when you finally fit the damn phone in the case it turns the volume up or down or turns the speaker on or off over and over! I'm so glad I found this case! It is made perfectly for the phone, has openings in all the right places, and best of all matches the rugged tough style and color of the i580 with it's grey with light grey details. I love the fact you can detach it simple buy unhooking the snap at the top for easy cleaning removal. The price is certainly right after spending over $100 for garbage with Nextel! You will LOVE this case!",

We actually returned a Motorola (HS850?) and got this one because the Motorola hook that went around the ear was a little flimsy so it flopped around a bit too much. This one feels sturdy and the ear piece fits comfortably, partially in the ear. The only reason it doesn't get a 5th star is it's not quite as intuitive as the Motorola's design that has the boom that flips open and close to turn it on/off.",

Here's my take on this:Looks pretty good with a shiny blue finish and small light which keeps flashing in different colours as per the mode it is inSound is pretty decent.90% of the times people could hear me clearly on the other end. I did not however have any difficulty to hear anyone and the reception was clear. Though you might face problems in hearing thru this in noisy environments. But then this is not a noise cancelling set anyway and wrong to expect that.Talk time is pretty decent. I charge it twice in 3 days so pretty good.The most irritating factor is the fit of this headset. It came with 3 different attachment and with each one of those it does not stay fixed to my ear and keeps wobbling. It is absolutely irritating to speak thru it if you are walking cos the headset keeps moving, it doesnt drop off though. I have average sized ears and the fit of these heasets had to be better.My recommendation for any blue tooth headset is one should go to a shop and try the fit first. I did not in this case and am planning to change this.",

    "text": "I don't have a lot of experience with Bluetooth headsets, but I can compare this to the low-end Jabra VBT 135 that came int he \"Bluetooth Package\" with my Verizon Wireless LG VX8300, and with the Motorola H850 that my wife and I bought at the same time as this one. The H670 is the best of the three.Many of the reviews I've seen for Bluetooth headsets talk about their styling, color and lights. Personally, I couldn't care less about that stuff. The thing sits on my ear where I don't see it, and in my opinion anybody using a headset looks pretty much like a dork no matter how \"stylish\" the ear dongle is. So, evaluate the look based on your preference.Functionally, however, there are a few things I really like:1. A discrete on/off switch. I despise buttons like the one on my Jabra, where you push the button for on/off...and to answer calls. This often results in doing a last-number redial when trying to shut off the stupid headset, so I much prefer the sliding switch of the H670.2. Multiple ear hooks. I was able to choose the one that fit snugly without pinching.3. Excellent sound quality both for calls and for voice dialing.4. Easy and reliable pairing.5. Good battery life.The H670 has everything on my list. I'll give it 4 stars just because I dont' have broad enough experience to rate it a 5. I do rank it as superior to the Motorola H850 (which isn't a bad unit by any means) and the low-end Jabra VBT 135 (which...well, in that case you get what you pay for).",

The magneting closure is secure, but easy to open when rushing to answer a call. Best of all, the design is as slim as the RAZR itself. I bought the RAZR because of its slim profile; I wanted a case to compliment it.I've since bought the red version of this pouch for my wife and recommended it to several friends who have also purchased it. This is a terrific accessory at a great price.",

It isn't even real leather. It's *cheap* \"pleather.\" After only two weeks, the clip is trying to tear away from the rest of the holster. I never ratcheted the clip, as they tend to loosen over time. Now, mine ratchets on its own. I often find that the holster is upside down. Were it not for the flap, there's no telling how many times it would have dumped the phone out by now. There are noticeable signs of wear and tearing all over the holster, and I haven't exposed it to rough treatment, either. I sit in a cubicle most days.I liked the fact that there was a metal tip on the clip, which kept the front edge of the clip from splitting/shredding as they often do. But that's the only good thing I can find to say about this product.There's a reason for its current price. It's not a bargain; it's flat-out cheap! Put a few bucks with the price they're asking for this one, and buy something --anything-- else.I'm now shopping for a new holster.",

Looked all over Amazon and settled on this because of the other reviews. It is well made. The closure strap keeps it there. Easy though to still access. The clip is built to last.

    "text": "I compared many ear pieces before buying 2. This one is a little uncomfortable, but only because I have never found an ear bud style that wasn't - I prefer the foam pads. It does come with 4 different tips so everyone should find one that is suitable. The most important thing was the sound quality which was excellent for both the mic and ear piece. It was durable - I've done everything including leaving it in the sand overnite then stepping on it - and it still works after 6 weeks. The answer/end feature is very convenient, and worked fine with my SidekickII. Overall very pleased.",

It holds to my ear better than most, it comes with couple different sizes of ear gel to aid that, it has a really well placed answer/end button on the boom, no searching the cord for it. The Cord doesn't get tangled up too badly. The sound quality is Great! Best of all, you can get them for $5!I tried out a handful of headsets before I got attached to this one, and this one simply has superior sound quality from a headset. I can understand everyone and they understand me much better than any other earpiece I've tested.Now, in my experience, its durability leaves something to be desired, though I'm not sure exactly what the benchmark for that should be. I will also say I'm extremely hard on these things. Nonetheless, when you can get them for $5 a pop on Amazon, I can stand to not cry over durability too much. As much as I abuse these, I probably buy 3-4 a year, but for the comfort, sound quality, and good design I get one of these every time!",

When I saw this case at the store, I was worried that the 'scuba' type plastic would be rough on the phone, but in reality it is very soft inside. It fits the 8100 like, well, a glove. I actually retured the leather one because I was so unhappy with the fit, but I have been very impressed with this one. It has a rotating detachable belt clip, plastic guards for the screens and keys, and a hole for the camera. It protects the phone while still allowing full access to all the buttons, charging ports, etc. Stylewise, it is black neoprene type stuff, with silver piping accents. I has a small plastic Body Glove logo under the screen on the outside. Overall, an amazingly durable, extremely well-fitting, and quite good-looking case for the 8100. Pick one up.",

However, I was severely disappointed with this pen's design.The top and bottom halves, like most pens, separate so that you can replace pencil lead &amp; ink cartridges. However, unlike most pens, the top and bottom of this pen do NOT screw together securely -- it's a pressure fit, with a slight lip, that does a terrible job of keeping the pen in one piece. A good deal of pressure on the button at the top will cause the bottom of the pen, at best, to loosen a little, and with enough pressure, will eject the bottom of the pen casing completely, sending you scrambling to reassemble it for use. Similarly, using the button to advance the pencil lead is impossible -- all it does is push the bottom half of the casing off the pen.",

When you get the product, there is no eraser on the pen, and the manual makes no mention of it.The clip does not hold to your pocket tightly, so be careful with it because it may fall. I just ran acorss the street and it fell out of my pocket and got run over by a car when the green light came on again, which is why I'm here buying another one.Otherwise, it's a great pen and a great buy compared to similar products out there.

Although the belt clip swiveled, allowing avoidance of the antenna stabbing me, the clip itself protruded and stabbed me.

I can have some difficulty removing the phone to answer a call. The 551 is a bluetooth phone. Once I have a bluetooth earbud I will be able to bypass this problem.

    "text": "I wear glasses and find that the typical over the ear headset is very cumbersome to put into place when I am wearing glasses. Sure, I can put it on first and then put on my glasses, but even then the area behind my ear is crowded -- and uncomfortable. Plus you are forced to put them on before hitting the road -- they are virtually impossible to put on once you are driving (not to mention dangerous).The iTech Clip is a good alternative. While not perfect, it sure beats what's out there now. The microphone is in the clip, which like any clip can be used on a shirt, T-shirt, sweater, etc.The earphone is just that -- an earphone (like an iPod earphone except that there is only one).I like to clip it on my shirt before heading off to work and keeping the earphone in my front pocket or dangling. When I get a call, I just place it in my ear and hit the little button on the earpod.Call quality is excellent and folks tell me they now hear me better than my last Bluetooth ear-piece, which cost 4 times as much. I recommend this product, though it took a few attempts to get it to pair with my phone. You just have to play around with it and it will eventually be recognized by your cell phone. Once paired, it is a snap to use.",

When I first started, I bought one and traded it in because I was dissatisfied which the first few. Then I kept one out of frustration rather than satisfaction and lived with it for several month until I lost it. After a few months without one at all I decide to get another. I spent the money on one that looked sexy and was highly rated. But again, the sound quality wasn't satisfactory. When I saw ad on Amazon for the iTech clip at such a low price I decided to give it a try as a backup and am happier with it that any other. It isn't sleek and sexy and discrete, but actually seems more practical than the standard design. I imagine that having the mic clipped to my shirt right below my voice works better than over on my ear especially with wind or car noise. And the clip design makes it easier to not lose.",

Sure its cheap in price and all, but to an average customer who may not realize the difference until something happens.A friend of mine had purchased this and i borrowed it at the office. I notice the charge was much slower than the OEM charger, after further investigation, I also noticed that it damaged my battery, after going back to oem.. my battery didnt hold as long of a charge. Ive been a long time user of all BB devices, and im sure just like you, you notice when something is difference especially when yuo use it like me 24/7 ..After calling RIM, they confirmed that some generic chargers are so poorly made and that even simple thing like a charger can damage the phone. They advised to either purchase oem or at least some brands that are reputable\"High Quality Home AC \" isnt exactly a reputable brand, and it makes sense.. these are the same cheap products you find in many dealers who give it away, because it cost them pennies, they sell on a quantity basis for profitsStay away !! If you can spend hundres for for a bb device, a $25 oem charger is worth it !",

I don't use my Bluetooth earpiece often, so when I did go to use it, the soft foam just crumbled in my hand. I was irritated with myself because I had no idea where to get a replacement foam covering.I should have remembered all the times Amazon has come to the rescue! When I found this foam replacement set, I was delighted because buying it would address another, nagging problem I've had -- the Plantronics headset picks up any slight breeze and makes it intolerable for the person on the other end of the phone conversation. So, buying this set let me replace the eartip PLUS add a windscreen to the speaker boom, too.Putting on the eartip cover was tough because it's a TIGHT fit, and you wonder if you're going to tear the eartip in the process (I didn't). Putting on the windscreen on the speaker boom was not as difficult, but it also was a tight fit. I did have the speaker boom windscreen fall off once when I was transporting the headset around in my pocket.What's really nice is that still have left-over pieces to this set that I can do another repair job in the future (as long as I remember where I stowed these pieces!).Highly recommended!",

    "text": "I have been using a Plantronics Voyager PLT-510 since about 1996. On average, I wear it anywhere from two to six hours a day during the week. The only complaint I have with it, is that the small cushioned gasket between the unit and the ear bud wears out quickly. Not too much of a complaint though, as I frequently put it on and take it off for client meetings and place it in my pocket or my laptop bag. As far as I'm concerned, this is the only con concerning the PLT-510. If you own one, definitely invest in this accessory kit! The only reason for a four-star rating is they could have made the cushioned gasket out of a better quality material (maybe rubber) so it would be more durable.",

    "text": "This phone has a lot to offer that may phones of this size cannot do, or just don't do quite as well. Although some people did not have an excellent experience with this device, so far, I have had a great one.PROS:Form factor - Following the new trend of the thin Razr-esque style, this phone is in a durable easy to open and close casing with well spaced keys and a mostly finger-print resistant shell. Buttons clicks very easily and with the exception of the somewhat slim side buttons, the overall casing is excellent. People with large hands may have a little trouble with the music controls on the front, but the same menus can be accessed with the phone open.Interface - This phone is just plain fast. My last phone was the Motorola L7 Slvr, and that has some major lag to it. This phone is lightning quick. The text messaging speed, browser load up speed, and music player interface are almost immediate. This is by far the fastest phone that I've come across, and very easy to navigate in. The only flaw is the split between the actual media center and mp3 player, but I adjusted fine, and really, I don't use it that much that it makes that big of a difference.Screen - Excellent screen. Very bright, very vivid. Even when the screen dims itself, it is still easy to read, and the colors just pop. The external screen is decent at best, but usually the external screens aren't up to par on phones of this size. Text is sharp, and darks are really rich.3G - For those that aren't familiar with exactly what 3G is, it is basically at type of internet access. It allows you to essential travel the internet at broadband speeds. While most webpages are pretty large to fit on this phone, and example of speed could be that MySpace took about 5 seconds to completely load. The AOL Instant Messanger (and other IMing apps) load pretty quickly... it took about 10 seconds to completely sign on and load my buddy list. Instant Messages are lightning fast, and feel as if it were in real time.Camera - This is a MegaPixel camera. 1.3 to be exact. Although there are 2MP and now even 3MP cameras in phones of this size, the clarity in mid-range lighting is still really good. It is a little muddy in dark areas, and if there is too much light, it is over exposed, but for a camera that has no flash, I found the pictures to be relatively good. Also, the camera swivels for self portraits or snap shots. If your photos are upside down, there is a reverse photo option that's easy to get to that just takes a second.Bluetooth - I would say an essential to phones these days. File transfers are quick. I haven't actually used a bluetooth headset on it, but it will accept all standard ones to my knowledge.MicroSD Card Slot - Although I think it can only accept a 1GB maximum at this point, it is still great to have, especially in an MP3 phone. I have heard speculation about a firmware update to get 2GB cards to read, but I can't confirm it. Make sure you ask your provider which brands will work, because not all MicroSD cards will work (all cell phones you should ask).Multimedia - The MP3 player is pretty good. I found that music that came out of it to be pretty clear, and the interface, although it takes some getting used to, is pretty good. This phone isn't designed to be an MP3 phone, it just has that option, so don't expect this to be above your expectation, but it still is very good.Call Quality - Very good. There was a nit pick I had about it, but that's later on in the review.Battery Life - I find it to be pretty good. It lasts about 3-4 days with casual talking and texting. You could probably stretch it to a week if you are a rare cell phone user. The AC adapter securely locks into place, and there is a rubber covering to protect it when not charging.CONS:Talk Issue - My only issue with the call quality, is that when the person you are talking to gets very quiet, the phone doesn't have anything that comes out of the speaker. Granted, I hate static, but at least I know my call didn't drop. I have yet to get a dropped call from this phone, but the sound dip kind of concerns me.Streaming - Streaming is only at 15FPS, so it's not too exciting, but pretty cool.Radio - The radio is a great addition, but uses hellacious amounts of data, I recommend getting an unlimited data package if you use this.Awkward MicroSD location - It's actually located behind that battery, so it's almost faster to transfer wirelessly than going through the hastles of a card rearder (unless you buy the USB connection).Media Package - I don't know if I just got ripped off, but when I was at the Cingular store, I was required to purchase the Media Works package for the internet and such. Granted I was going to get it anyways, but for people that just want to get this phone off Amazon for free, it's kinda iffy. I don't know if Amazon requires you to get this deal, but I recommend it because data gets expensive. Plus with a camera and 3G, the features get addicting.BOTTOM LINE",

    "text": "I recently upgraded my phone to an LG CU500. I am very pleased. Here's why:This is a very attractive phone. It looks similar to the RAZR, but it does not have the same wide body. (I do not care for the wide body of the RAZR, it makes it hard to fit in pockets.) I also like the slim body. It is slim enough, but it still feels sturdy. The phone is black with chrome around the external display and the external music controls. When you flip open the phone, you see a great, bold colored screen. You can customize BOTH screens with wallpapers and how you want to display the date and time.The reception is great. I can hear crisp and clear, and for those other phones that you've had that just don't get loud enough when you're talking, the highest talk volume (7) on this phone is plenty loud enough, I have to keep it on 5 so I won't go deaf. I didn't think the reception would be so clear because of the internal antenna, but it is as clear as it could be.The buttons on the phone are raised above the surface, unlike many other slim phones, such as the RAZR, the KRZR, or some of Samsung's slim phones. Under the external display are the music buttons. Which are Rewind/Back, Play/Pause, and Forward/Next. On the left side of the phone are two buttons, the rocker and the task button. If the phone is closed you can punch the task button and you can go to the MP3 player, take a photo, or record a video. If the phone is open and you hit the task button, you get the \"Task Menu\" which brings you to all the available tasks. (MEdia Net Home, Music Player, Games, Applications, Call, Write Message, Message Box, IM)The phone has a 1.3 mega pixel camera, which is capable of video too. It takes clear, crisp photos and can zoom. The camera lens can rotate 180 degrees to take a self portrait, or to take one of someone else. Each time you rotate the lens, the display is upside down, so you hit the rocker button to flip it right side up.If you hit the right soft key, the phone pulls up My Menu. This menu is extremely convenient. You make this menu, adding the items you want.I have not tried the MP3 player yet because you have to buy a separate USB cable that hooks up through the charger port of the phone. You can add memory to the CU500 with micro SD cards.The ringtones are loud and get attention. There are only a few that I really like, but the rest are OK. The ringtones are ascending, so it starts out average volume and increases to loud, and there is no option to change it, but it's not a big problem for me.This phone is also 3G capable, which means it can get Cingular's fastest internet speeds.I highly recommend that you get this phone. It is the best phone out right now. I don't think they will come out with a phone better than the LG CU500 soon.[...]",

However, as a phone, this device was a nuisance.What I didn't like:- The ear piece hurts my ear even if I'm on the phone for just a few minutes and pressing lightly. The edges of the speaker are sharp.- The sound quality of the voice on the other end is awful. It often sounds staticy and cuts in and out. I also have heard my own voice echoing in my own ear which makes it nearly impossible to talk.-Drops calls. I have had the same service and live in the same area and didn't have this problem with the razr.- Bulky, feels awkward in my hand. Not easy to flip open/shut.- If I set the phone on silent, the alarm that I use to wake up will also be silent! Not so on the razr.- Texting awkward, doesn't autofill words. No parentheses!- Battery life is terrible. Razr has way better battery life which is hard to believe.I've read a bunch of reviews on this phone and most of them say that the media accessories are great but the actual phone part of the phone is awful.I really thought I was getting a phone that did neat tricks. All I got was the tricks. I'm returning it and getting another razr since my other one was stolen. Mostly, I'm tired of having a sore ear.",

It has Cingular Video and high speed data (3G, but only in certain large areas). Good battery life and clarity. Loud speaker phone, blue tooth. Cool camera too, seems like a nice, durable phone.Cons:It doesn't allow you to change to soft keys. The phone ring type ascends only, you cannot change this. Seems like the voice of the person you are talking to also ascends slightly. The alarm doesn't have volume controls, but I don't use that anyway. There are a few minor user interface flaws, but overall a great phone. I would recommend it.",

    "text": "I switched from the razor to the CU500 and I must say im pretty glad I did, well far as better options. Unlike other phones I had, it would be difficult to see when the sun is shinning unless you play with the screen controls. But when I got this phone I dont have that problem.~PROS~- Like I mentioned the screen is good even when the sun is shinning directly on you. You can still see the screen clear- The photo editor is GREAT!. Same thing with the GIF maker- LOTS! of options. I had this phone for about two weeks and I find new options everyday lol. Just like yesterday I found out you can take pictures of the video you've recorded- Recording a video is a big plus. Record up to 14 minutes~CONS~- Im under pick your plan and using the MP3 player uses up data towards your bill. I never reliezed that untill I kept wondering why my minutes would be so low everyday. Unless you get unlimited usage best bet is to not use the MP3 player- Same goes for the radio. Uses lots of data. Same with mobilTV, and Cingular video- You cant assign text message tones. It has annoying text message tones. The only way to turn them off is to completly put the phone on vibrate- As everyone else said, the phone doesnt come with nothing but a charger. I brought the phone from the cingular store and the USB cable there was 24.99. But on other sites I seen some for 8.99~Summary~Its a good phone its just some things that LG should of took a second look at before releasing the phone. Because I text alot and those text message tones are annoying as hell lol. Especially the message that lets you know the text message was sent or even when you delete something. Plus its hard to constantly keeping your phone on vibrate when your at home. Thats just for the text message junkies. If you dont text or text that much you shouldnt have a problem with it.",

It has a great looking design, and on paper it looks to be loaded with lots of neat features. BUT:- The battery in this phone drains very QUICKLY. I should have realized this b/c the specs on the phone rate the talk time at 3.5 hours for UMTS mode and 5 hours for GSM mode. Compare that to the Sony W810i (9 hrs talk time!). I haven't figured out how to keep the phone in GSM mode so that the battery might last longer.- Good luck with the micro SD memory card used on this phone. Just do a Google search on \"problems with LG CU500 memory card\" and you will see what I mean! The biggest problem is the error message \"card not ready.\" IF you get past that hurdle, a lot of people still complain that the card takes way too long to store data, or gives other errors. I think manufacturers are rushing these new phones to market way too quickly, complete with all the bugs.Sorry, I felt I must warn people out there. BEWARE of these problems. Other than those gripes, the phone had great clarity and volume in the earpiece. If you're not tech-savvy and all you care about is using the phone as a phone, you'll be OK, but the wimpy battery is still going to annoy you.",

I liked the features and the look & feel of the phone, but was not happy with this phone in particular,(there are other phones out there that have most of the same features). Here's why I returned it:1. Ascending ring. -Couldnt hear it at first until it finally gets louder.2. The phone would go silent on me or the person on the other end alot. And no, it wasn't a problem with Cingular's service because I have had other phones that have worked just fine in the same areas and I wasn't traveling at the time of these happenings. I would be just sitting at home, talking, and suddenly the person on the other end would be like, \"hello??\" I could hear them, they couldn't hear me! This happened 3 times during one phone call!!! Thats not acceptable to me when I've had a Motorola, a Nokia, and a Sony Ericson phone before and did not have this problem!!3. While the rotating camera is a cute idea, it is also a pain since it rotates way too easily in my opinion.I ended up returning this LG phone for a Razr v3xx, which I love! I've never had a razr before, but am so happy with it, (had it now for 2 weeks)! I do like to give phones a chance before I just return them, and I wont be returning the Razr. It has alot of the same features as this CU500, without the above problems!",

It's 3-G is extremely fast and user friendly. Screen is good for watching news, videos and whatever's available on the corresponding network. As a camera is OK, not many features and no flash. Photo editing is basic but adequate for the average user.Battery life was not what LG or Cingular/ATT claimed and an extended battery is not available. When surfing the web or in constant talk time, lasts one hour on the average. Standby mode will last 36 hours if no calls are made and the internet is not used.The other problem is the phone reception. Although the bars may indicate full strength, the signal is very poor and callers will complain that they barely hear you. This is not limited to indoors or steel buildings; happens everywhere (at least in South Florida).Stay away from this phone and consider one of the \"Berries\" instead. I had mine for six months and three batteries.UPDATE 12/07",

The only thing that truly annoyed me about the phone is the annoying little conformation chime that CANNOT BE TURNED OFF!?! Are you kidding me. Unless you have the phone on silent or vibrate and you change a setting, delete something, send a message, etc it makes an annoying LOUD chime. And as I said, it can't be turned off. Now to the best of the worst of the phone! Whenever talking to someone on the phone, they hear the most obnoxious humming/buzzing sound ever. You know that sound that speakers make when your cell phone is near them and it's about to ring? That weird humming/buzz noise? Yeah, that's exactly what the other person on the line hears. And it's quite loud, loud enough that at times I can't even be heard. Oh and not to mention dropped calls. There have been several times when this thing has dropped a call 3 or 4 times in a row. Talk about annoying. Other times it'll drop a call once and then I can call back and get back to the conversation...but i mean...seriously?Bottom line",

Despite all the wonderful feature, I switched back to a Motorola and bought the RAZR V3r because the reception from the LG was not that good. The reception wasn't the fault of the service provider because the problems went away when I acquired the RAZR. My observations on the LG CU500 are:1) Small and compact. Not as wide as a RAZR, but a little thicker.2) Very easy to use.3) Phone only comes with a charger and nothing else. You will have to buy all the accessories separately.4) This phone takes an optional MicroSD card, so it's nice to be able to expand on your storage.5) You can use regular headphones with this LG, but the jack has to be 2.5mm. It's better than having to buy a proprietary headphone from the cell phone manufacturer, like you would have to do with other phones.6) Video recording is limited to only 20 seconds. I don't usually need more than this, but it's nice not being limited.7) Reception was not as good as the RAZR. Despite all the great features, I need this to be a phone and therefore, reception is of utmost importance to me.Good luck to you whichever phone you decide on!!",

It seems to be pretty durable, except for the flimsy cover that is on the charging port - it will break off, I'm 100% sure of that. It's a nice looking phone...I held it up to the Samsung Sync and in my opinion it looks better then that due to the Sync looks like a toy due to the plastic. For the price, the phone has a ton of features! I'm not going to go and list pro's/con's but I will touch base on why I am not satisfied with this phone. Since these features or non features are not listed when you go into the store.Why I am returning:- The ring is ascending ONLY! There is no way to fix this...by the time its loud enough for me to hear it, the caller has hung up (VERY annoying)- Ring tones are horrible- You cannot customize your contacts. Meaning no assignable ring tones or photo ID.- Every time you go to write a text message, and you have to stop or start over, it saves to draft.- A very annoying alert tone every time you access something from a menu. For instance, take a picture and then go to options to delete or send - you get an annoying chime.So if any of these issues are important for you to have on a phone, then don't buy this one. If they don't really matter then check it out cause you will probably enjoy this phone.",

    "text": "I just upgraded to this phone after using an older LG model for 3+ years. Well, in 3+ years, phones have improved quite a bit. If you add in memory, you can store and transfer files. For me, that means transfering MP3s, which you can play with the built in music player. The phone also is Bluetooth enabled, allowing for wireless connection with other Bluetooth devices. Of course, I went out and bought a Bluetooth USB adapter and had it set up within an hour or so. There's also a camera that swivels through 6 positions and has very good picture quality considering the tiny lens you're working with.The downsides to the phone mainly involve all the add-ins you may or may not want to buy. A memory card is not included, nor is a data transfer cable. Standard headphones will require an adapter to connect with the 2.5 mm port. Bluetooth is also a relatively slow method to transfer files if you want to move 100+ MB in files. However, all of these are peripheral to the phone itself, so that really comes down to the guys selling the device, not the device itself. The one intrinsic element I don't like is the music player. While it locates MP3 files easily, the phone doesn't sync up with iTunes or WMP like a pure MP3 does. But this is relatively minor since it just means you pick out your files and transfer them manually.Battery life seems to be decent and I've run my phone for several days under normal usage without requiring a recharge. I don't put a particularly heavy load on my phone, though, so big talkers and texters may feel differently.Most of the negative reviews come down to people who either aren't smart enough to figure out how to work their phone or who blame provider issues like poor reception on the phone itself. You may have different preferences for what you want in a phone or are used to a different configuration of buttons. But if you can adjust to the interface and the soft keys (they're really not that bad), then you'll be fine. This is definitely an amusing toy with the added benefit of being a good cell phone as well.",

The Cingular rep I spoke to also indicated that this phone might possibly be used for videoconferencing in the future. Since I needed to upgrade, I thought I might as well go for a 3G phone, since I would be stuck with it for a while. I put it through its paces with one solid day of extensive use.Pros",

The keypad has similar stainless steel look but buttone have black around them.*Lots of little features including MP3 player, Cingular video and other internet features.*Ear volume is loud and I love it. After years of listening to loud music I need earpieces that radiate conversations and this does just that.CONS*Cant move too many volume options including alarm volume and ascending ringtone*Message tones are limited and cheap. With the Razr, you could use any sound you wanted to.*The MicroSD chip takes way too long to load.*Ringtone length is limited, the Razr was not.Other than that this phone is great, if you can get a good deal with a new or existing plan, I recommend the LG CU500",

    "text": "I absolutely hate this phone. Everyday it makes me want to throw it out my window. I switched to Cingular from Sprint in August strictly because most of the people I talk to have Cingular and I kept going over my minutes. So I didn't really like any of the phones they had in-store (I went to 3) and I didn't want the Razor and the guy told me that this was the best phone they had and it would definitely get better reception than the Razor. BULL. I am missing having Sprint with my beautiful tiny silver Samsung, I think it was the A670 (that Cingular does not have).1. The reception sucks, and it's not Cingular. My boyfriend and his sister both have Cingular, they live out in the sticks and they both get service just fine and I don't. He has a Nokia, she has the Razor.2. Half the time it says I have full service but it won't ring. So I miss most of my calls and txts cuz the stupid thing doesn't ring.3. You can't assign Ringtones to particular people! What the heck, this phone has an MP3 player but you can't assign ringtones, which I didn't realize 'till I already purchased 3. I called LG and they said you could only assign them to groups, which I did exactly how they told me to and I could never get it to work.4. My old phone had lights on the outside that would blink if you missed a call or a msg, and you could have the option of having it actually beep if you missed a call or a msg, this phone doesn't do that so I am constantly having to check it.5. It is really quiet, both the ring and the voice, and the speakerphone isn't that loud. By boyfriends 4 year old Motorola he had before his new Nokia had a way better speaker.6. It has the absolute worst battery life in the world. Sometimes I won't use it all day, I won't even open it, and the batter will be dead. What the heck is up with that?The only good thing I can say about it is that I like the big screen and the picture quality is really good. It would have been nice to not have to buy the cord to download the pictures separately though, the phone was nearly $200, they could have at least thrown the cord in, or at least the car charger, I had to buy that too, which was $30 and quit working about 3 months after having it.I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone, I don't know if it's LG or just the model but it is the cause of major frustration for me every single day! If I could give it zero stars I would have.",

The charging port has a cover so nothing can get inside there unlike the Motorola phone i used to have. I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great! Works well with Bluetooth devices. You can use it as an internet connection for a laptop or anything that is Bluetooth capable. This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used. The only bad thing about the phone is the ringtones it came with. I just want a simple ring and it couldnt offer me that so I ended up recording the ring from my old Motorola and now I am satisfied. Battery life is pretty good depending how much you use it but I have noticed that if it has one bar left it will still go for 8 hours. Overall this phone is a great product from LG",

YAY! The phone plays music...most do nowadays. YAY! The phone takes excellent pictures...I still take my digital camera with me on vacation...YAY! Internet access is wicked fast...The phone does these things very well...YAY for LG.But really...the main reason anyone purchases a phone is make and receive PHONE CALLS, not take pictures, videos, etc, etc, etc. This is where the most negative elements of the phone come up.Negative aspect #1",

    "text": "I got a LG CU500 about 6 months ago from Amazon. The phone worked great and suited my needs, but it started going haywire a couple of weeks ago. For some reason, the phone would call the last person I talked to while it was closed and in my pocket. This is a flip phone and there are no buttons on the side or front of the phone that allow you to place calls, so it was not a case of me accidentally pressing on one of the buttons in my pocket. I just took the phone to my local AT&T store, and they showed me that barely touching the headphone jack on the side of the phone brings up the recent calls menu and dials my last call. The people at AT&T informed me that I am not the first person they have seen with this problem and the only way I can get it fixed is for AT&T to send me a replacement phone. This has been a very annoying problem and I am glad I am getting a new phone.",

    "text": "1. The phone. The phone has good reception and good audio quality. The address book is user friendly and holds a lot of data. Although it is often over looked the purpose of a cell phone is to function as a phone...and this phone is good in all respects. The phone as a jack for hand free capability and for wireless bluetooh capability.2. The MP3 player. The phone only holds a 1 gig SD card, and I would suggest you use ScanDisc and not a rival company, and while that may seem limited by some I am satisfied. I am able to store almost 300 hundred songs. The player is easy to manipulate and has the ability to creat favorite lists in which you can arrange the songs.3. The camera. If a person has the camera setting set to the highest resolution this camera takes beautiful pictures. You have to have the SD card if you take a lot of pictures because the sim card's memory is too small to store a lot of pictures. The video feature takes poor video and will not play on most modern computer media players.The size of the phone is great. It's large enough to reach from ear to mouth but slim enough to slip into your pocket with out leaving a bulge. This phone is older know but it is a 3G phone and still works great.

I ended up purchasing another phone a full retail and junking mine!A couple of other gripes about this phone include:- The ring tones are terrible so plan on buying one.- The ringer volume starts low and get's louder on each successive ring and you can't change this. If the phone is in another room, by the time it's loud enough to hear, you won't catch the call.- You can't turn the chime off for text messages, even when the phone is in silent mode for say a movie or meeting, your phone will chime when you get a text message.- The speaker/earpiece is loud, but for some reason still hard to hear.On the plus side, the 3G internet is fast and it can tether to the computer and make a not so bad and cheap wireless modem for a laptopLG?

    "text": "I've had this phone for a couple of weeks now & I've found it has a lot of good points, but coming from someone who's used to Motorolas, I've been missing quite a few things with this phone.First, it does have the 3G network which is amazing for super fast web browsing. I can't imagine going back to the old way. Everything loads within seconds.I love that you can rotate the camera, but that can be a nuisance if it was pointing one way & then you need to reverse the image to change it for later pictures. I was disppointed with the quality of the pictures though. I had better pics w/the Razr. I took a few pictures & sent them to a friend & he was only able to see 1.This phone has a lot of great options, but you have to pay for nearly all of them. For example, to watch tv clips from channels like TLC & Animal Planet, you need to pay $10/month; for HBO it's $5/mo. And those are only few minute clips-- not a whole show. For the radio it's another montly charge. You could easily rack up a bill for hundreds of dollars a month just to utilize all of these features on top of paying a regular phone bill.The ringtones were a big disappointment. Unlike the Razr where you can apply different rings to different things (i.e. vibrate for texts, ring for calls, etc), there is no way to have vibrate only. You can only do it before ringing or while ringing (or just plain silent) & if you have it silent, it's silent for everything--calls, texts, etc. The ringtones provided were awful. Before I got it, I checked out the other reviews & saw people wrote this too. I figured how bad could they really be?? They're bad. Bad! There's only one that actually sounds like a phone (it's called old ring) but even that's just ok. THe others are like weird, annoying songs. Very odd.I noticed the battery life is so so. I charge it about every other day & I don't even use the phone that much. If I were to make calls or use the internet, I'd have to charge it every night.I haven't gotten any dropped calls or weird variances in volume although I have found myself often straining to hear what the other person is saying. However, I've not found the calls to start out loud & gradually get lower as someone else mentioned.It's nice to be able to change the internal & external displays. You can have one image for the inside screen & another for the outside. They only provide you with 3 or so wallpapers (no screensavers) but you can use your own anyway.The screen goes black pretty quickly if you're not doing something every second. First the key lights go off & then the screen dims then goes black pretty quickly. I find that a little annoying.Storing numbers was a hassle as well. I liked the way the Razr worked in terms of this a lot better. It would show you distinguishable icons next to the person's name so you could just see what device you wanted right away. This one works a little differently & it's not as easily noticeable.All in all I think this isn't such a bad phone. I'm most likely going to get the Apple iphone when it comes out in June so just to use this phone for 3-4 months is fine. I'm sure I'll be over it by then anyway. If you don't need a ton of bells & whistles, then I'm sure you'll be happy with this phone.",

I signed up for the full media package with video and all the bells and whistles and the video would go into buffer zone forever after playing about 15 seconds of a 3 min clip. This was my second CU500 phone from cingular. New sim card, new phone, same problems. My signal was always 5 bars strong in the 3g mode, yet, still dropped calls and nobody could hear me. My best guess about this phone is that LG rushed this phone to market to compete with the razor from motorola.(As we all know that the razor is always sold out at the cingular stores.) I would not recommend this phone to anybody who needs a reliable source of communication. Cell phone quality has dropped in the last 4 years since I brought a phone, so I can't really recommend any brands. Cingular service has been PERFECT so far before I brought this phone so go figure what's the problem. There is another reviewer on this page having the same problems as I did as well.",

The silicone cover fits like a glove and has a good finish as to not attract dust, dirt and fuz. The hard plastic gives it a good grip and makes.it feel more sturdy than most covers. I like the protection of oversized corners but these are giant and make it just large.enough that it wont fit in my shirt pockets orthe cell pockets on my shorts and pants.

The real convenience of this product is that it holds my phone upright even in its protective cover, and it charges & stores my additional battery, which is small and easy to misplace. With all of its drawbacks, if you do a lot of work at your desk, especially using bluetooth, it eventually comes in handy to have your screen displayed upright & out of the clutter. Overall, this product is puzzling, it comes with no manual, arrives in just a plastic bag, and, while it's certainly cheaper than the $40 models out there, it's hard to tell if it's really worth 20 bucks.",

The cradle actually worked better for charging the phone than the charger that came with the phone, though it still has the same problem. However, the slot for charging the battery simply did not work (and that was the main thing for which I wanted this item). I did have the cradle plugged into the USB port, and I did have the other line plugged into the wall. I took the thing apart to see if there were any loose wires, but I couldn't find any; the solder connections all looked solid, and the wires were all in place.

At first I didn't even notice The Generation X Cell Antenna or thought it was a coupon of some sort. I'm not sure now because everything's a little blurry. I guess it sat on my desk while I was trying out the product I'd purchased. Suddenly The Generation X Cell Antenna levitated itself from my desk, started spinning, faster and faster now, until it was invisible except as a kind of longitudinal wave in the fabric of spacetime. Then I started feeling faint and just as I was passing out or something, the Generation X Cell Antenna longitudinal wave passed first over and then through me before bolting towards a window. Then it passed right through the window as though it had been thrown by David Blaine. Without shattering the window!That was the last time I ever saw that Generation X Cell Antenna. At first I was kinda glad because I felt kind of exhausted all of a sudden. But then I crawled into bed and had the deepest, richest, most clear dreams ever. They were really hot for awhile, if you know what I mean (Hi Jessica!), until my final dream, which was like apocalyptic or something. Woke up feeling things are looking kind of bleak for our species, if it's true there are people almost like us living on the Sun (Hi Angelina!). And they're angry.Would have given the Generation X Cell Antenna five stars except that when I brushed my teeth this morning I found on the brush a tiny piece of metal. Under a microscope it looked exactly like the Generation X Cell Antenna. A ha, I thought, I've been chipped with a fractal of the Generation X Cell Phone Antenna. I don't know, I kind of think that's not cool. Then again I also wonder if maybe they put that there so the real Jessica could find me. Guess I'll never know, since when I turned away for a second a Lady Bug flew in my window, grabbed the Generation X Cell Phone Antenna and flew back out the window. Or so my girlfriend says. Normally I wouldn't even believe that but since the window was closed the whole time, but after what I've seen of the Generation X Cell Antenna, anything is possible. Right?",

And it is rather off-putting that you cannot change batteries, when it wears out it's done.I have just replaced it with the high-end Jabra BT-800 which has a caller ID window, call alert vibration, a regular belt-case, and can even charge via USB, but it is much more uncomfortable to wear and literally hangs on your ear as it does not stick in to your ear canal. But my callers do notice that it is clearer due to the DSP.",

    "text": "The V3x is larger than the normal Razr, and requires a special case.I liked the look and optional accessories for the Krusell. It lasted maybe two months. The leather is high quality and the plastic is shaped to fit the phone. Overall the case is very well made. I think the design is just poor. W/in a month, the leather had stretched such that when you open the phone to use it, the cover for the display would slide up and almost off of the phone (not enough material on the front to keep it on the display half of the phone. I dealt with that. It was annoying, but tolerable. Besides, there were very few options, so what could I do anyway? Then the plastic on the bottom ripped. They used good quality stitching to connect the plastic to the leather, but since the plastic is maybe 1/2\" wide (and pretty thin) on the upper part of the bottom section, the holes for the stitching acted like perforations. Good for notebook paper. Not so good for phone cases.I did not abuse the case. I believe if they redesigned it to have more places on the front side that actually hold the phone, even if they were plastic, it could be a great product. They did not skimp on materials, or manufacturing. It is very well made, and actually looks really nice. Unfortunately, it has so little material on the inside of the phone (the front when you open it) that it just doesn't stay on and will eventually fail.Too bad in this case (pardon the pun). The optional belt and other accessories that connect to the case made it very desirable for me. If they work out the case itself, I may purchase another. In it's current design, I'd say find something generic and use that. That is what I ended up having to do.You usually get what you pay for, but this time, the extra money doesn't buy you anything. That's why I only gave this well made case one star. It is expensive well constructed case. If it has lasted a year, I would have rated it much higher. Two months is simply unacceptable.Also, if you haven't purchased the V3x yet, you may want to reconsider the lack of case options as well. I like my phone, but the lack of holsters and cases is continues to be an issue.",

In a poor signal area...3 bars or less, fades very fast, even when not in use. However, for $4.50 (compared to my old price), it is a very inexpensive backup and with the leaps in tecnology, maybe a battery and phone that lasts 2 year is about right.

This thing has great quality sound, I have a small recording setup in my house and decent experience with different microphones and the sound quality that this device delivers is impressive. The interface is very easy, you plug it in and access it in your menu, or if you are in a hurry there is a button on the side you can press to instantly start recording. If you don't think that the sound quality is good enough there is an option to plug in another mic into the bottom of the device. I use this at live shows, i can get direct output from the mixer, so i can plug a 3.5mm stereo jack (headphone jack) into the bottom of the tunetalk and the other end into the \"headphone out\" on the mixer and it will record everything that is going through the mixer out to the PA. This gives much much better sound quality than if i were to just put my ipod on the stage to record. Great device, great price. I highly recommend it.",

Anyone who expects better should be spending 3-4 times the price.- Small size, Light weight- Easy to use. Ataches easily. Menu functions are very intuitiveCons (?):- A few other people have mentioned battery life. I use the Tune talk with a 60gb photo iPod. With a full charge on the iPod I've recorded for more than 2 hours at a time and still been left with the battery half charged. This will vary by model, but for those people using this in a class setting, or a place where they are using a laptop as well, the Tune Talk comes with a USB cable that will allow you to charge your iPod as you record.Conclusion",

    "text": "I had previously used the Griffin iTalk for the G3 an G4 iPods and while an excellent product, the sound quality was 8 bit and the range was approximately 6 feet.The Tune Talk is a significant a step as the change from the original iPod to the video iPod.Sound Quality - Excellent. With the autogain off the recording is completely hiss free. With autogain on some his and distortion is introduced but it is acceptable. Stereo separation is good, excellent when you consider how small the microphone is. The two quality settings - high and low - correspond to 44.1 kHz (CD quality) and 22 kHz.Format - the files are in the WAV format and run about 10MB per minute I high quality mode. These can easily be converted in to mp3 or any other format.Features - The built in Autogain makes recording in large rooms or even outdoor settings practical. I have used it in small classrooms (10 person), large auditoriums (90 person) and outdoor theaters (200+ people). The quality is exceptional considering the small size. There is also an external input for either an microphone or line input (1/8th inch stereo) that allows your iPod to serve as a storage device for a higher quality recording setup. I used a direct input from one iPod to another using a male/male cable and there was no noticeable loss of quality. I am sure if you put the recordings on an analyzer you would see a difference but my ears couldn't tell. I have used this to digitize old analog tape recordings with excellent results.Controls are minimal. Plug it into the dock connector and your iPod automatically goes to the record menu. Press the Play/pause button and you begin recording. Once recording begins the center button acts as a pause. Once your are done, scroll the clickwheel to \"Stop and Save.\" When the save is complete, you go to a menu with your recording. File names are a date/time stamp. If you have the Tune talk already attached but you are doing something else (listening to music) you can go straight to the recording menu by pressing a button on the left of the Tune Talk. On the bottom along with the autogain and line input is a mini USB connector that allows you to power your iPod while recording. Recordings eat battery life fast. At full power you can get about 90 minutes of recording from a battery. After hat you run the risk of running out of juice during the disk write operation. Belkin includes the cable (nice) and a plastic holder that allows hands free recording (also nice).The uses for the Tune Talk are only limited by your imagination. I use them in an education setting for spoken homework and recording lessons. I have also used them to record meetings, record plays and even notes to myself. The Tune Talk would make an excellent device for an on the fly Podcast. Combined with Apples GarageBand you could record, mix and post a podcast in a matter of minutes.Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I recently purchased the Belkin Tunetalk for my 5G Video iPod. I bought it for the purpose of recording lectures. For shorter recordings, the Tunetalk works great. The sound quality is excellent. However, when I try recording anything above 30minutes, the audio starts skipping. What's worse is that after lecture is over (almost an hour of recording), I hit the 'Stop and Save' button, the screen stays on the 'Saving' screen for a couple minutes, and then loads up the 'Voice Memos' screen. Assuming the recording was successly saved, I then try to play the recording, and the iPod completely freezes. It takes a complete reset just to get the thing to turn off.When I do finally play the recording I find that even though the length of the recording is listed as 50 minutes long, when I try to play anything past the 30 minute or so mark, the recording stops and takes me right back to the 'Voice Memos' screen. This is especially frustrating because throughout recording the red light remains on leaving one to believe it's still recording what its supposed to. So I guess the issue comes when the Tunetalk tries to save such a lengthy file. Which leaves me out of luck, and missing crucial take home points made at the end of lecture.I thought this might have been a battery issue, as I've read that the Tunetalk will cut off the last 25 minutes of a recording if the battery is too low. So I tried recording with the Tunetalk connected to my desktop via the USB cable. The same problems persisted. Skipping audio and missing the last 20 minutes of my hour long recording.While the sound quality is excellent, I found the Belkin Tunetalk useless for longer term recordings such as lectures, which is unfortunate especially considering \"records lectures\" is specifically listed under the product description.",

    "text": "Despite reading negative comments in the other reviews, I decided to try the TuneTalk for myself. I thought that it couldn't be that bad. Since I carry my iPod all the time and I carry a small recorder (m-audio Microtrack 24/96), I thought that I could save myself space in my bag by carrying a small mic for the iPod. I'll tell you my personal pluses and minuses:Pluses:Set up is very easy. You'll be making recordings very quickly.The recordings are clear, but a little hissy, with or without the automatic gain control.And it's very small which is convenient.Minuses:No monitoring through your headphones while recording. You need to do a test recording and then play it back to hear what you're getting.No way to adjust the record volume beyond choosing automatic gain or no automatic gain.I tried 2 different external mics and didn't get them to work properly. I think they needed more voltage for their phantom power.The mic picks up the hard drive clicks of the iPod. So much that it ruins any recording you'd want of, let's say, a recording of birds outside your house.Poor stereo separation.If you need more than a device to record lectures, voice notes or loud music, then this isn't your solution. You get what you pay for and $55 dollars won't get you the quality of units costing $350+. I suppose I should hunt for a better microphone for my Microtrack.I guess I was just a dreamer, hoping for something wonderful with this unit. My unit is heading back for a refund.",

In voice lessons/coaching sessions, it picks up both piano and voices clearly without drowning one or the other out.I've even begun using it just a a personal voice recorder for memo's and reminders.

I had to move the plug around a bit and apply more pressure than any other ipod docking plug I have ever used. Finally, it plugged in. Unlike what it says in the manual, the record function did not automatically start. What did happen was a \"voice memo\" line appeared under extras, I believe it was. When I selected that, it had an option to set the record quality to high or low, and a start recording option. I started the record, let it run for 20 seconds, and stopped it. The recording I had just made appeared right under the quality setting option and the start record option. I highlighted it, pushed the center button, and play and delete options appeared. Playing it, I was pleased with the quality.After coming back to the device later, I tried plugging it back in, had the same problem with the stubborn plug. It recorded fine again. I made another recording with the auto gain on to see the difference. It definitely amplifies nicely, but adds hiss.The next recording I tried came out as a hash of hissing, static and crackling. If you are old enough, you have heard an old AM radio in a thunderstorm. That crackling and popping was very close to what I got out of this microphone after that.The plug obviously has something wrong with it judging from the way it didn't want to work smoothly. Whether or not that was the cause of the hideous noise on all subsequent recordings I can't say. I unplugged and replugged it numerous times, and always got that hash of static and crackling.To say I'm disappointed in this device is an uderstatement. I hate shoddily constructed defective equipment. The \"stand\" that it comes with is simply a folded piece of plastic. The \"quick memo\" button on the side of the microphone doesn't work with the ipod classic. I could have overlooked either of these things if it has survived more than three recordings and the plug had worked even decently.Buyer beware.",

Since I already had both, and was an old pro at using them, I found the Belkin device a breeze to use. Just charge up your iPod, and plug the device in. It automatically takes your iPod to a menu designed for recording voice memos on it. You're given only a couple of choices including \"record\" , or \"stop\". By selecting record, the iPod takes input from the stereophonic mics, which are of decent clarity. Mind you, this is not super high fidelity. Its plenty high fidelity for recording a room, even a room with quite a few people in it, thanks to the automatic gain control. Those sitting close enough to it come out clear and undistorted.It records directly to mp3 format, so by choosing the medium resolution, you use up approximately 1 megabyte per minute. My iPod is a 60 gigabyte machine. That's a lot of time! But it really doesn't matter since once you're done recording, you can sync to your iTunes, which places everything from your iPod into a playlist called \"voice memos\". You can then do anything you want with the recordings, including burning them to a cd, and deleting them from iTunes which effectively lets you start all over, without using any of the space on your iPod.I've been using mine to record my band. When you are trying to teach a new band member tunes quickly, it's easiest to simply record the way the band does them at rehearsal, then transfer them to cd and let the new musician take them home to learn. It works great for that. It also allows me to send low fidelity recordings to my friends who live far away. Its not like sending a studio recording, but they get the idea.I love this thing. Great invention, well executed.Zoot says check it out.",

It was an old iPod, so I gave the Belkin device the benefit of the doubt and bought a new 30G iPod Video Black on eBay.

It was then that I discovered that the Belkin was the problem, not the iPod, and I threw this piece of trash out and bought a digital recording device separate from any iPod.

This leads to very choppy, often unintelligible audio, for the listener. Reviews seemed to indicate this was a solvable problem through software updates, etc. On that basis I decided to buy this.Unfortunately, I experienced the problem noted above. I did the recommended restore of my device and made sure that everything was updated to the latest software. The problem persists.I emailed Belkin. The email response I received, which consisted of several misspelled words, nonsensical sentences, and other unprofessional elements, was of no help at all. I'm contacting them again in hopes that this problem can be solved. Take my advice--avoid this product. Maybe you'll have better results than I did, but do a bit of research.

I don't know why there are complaints about the sound of the hard drive spinning, but my iPod is always updated with the latest firmware so I never had any problems from the start. I always use the highest setting so the sound quality is awesome both for voice and music. The built-in mics are a compromise and we should not expect too much from it except for voice memos. For music, the best would be to get a direct feed from a mixer or instrument via the line-in or invest in the Audio Technica Stereo mic (and even then you have to be careful about WHERE you position this set-up). Also, make sure you have a power source attached for long recordings. Here's a tip; I use my PSP's mini USB cable (really short) with an iPod USB AC power adapter - it works! My gripes are mainly with the user interface which does not allow for any flexibility. But we can rename the files after the fact anyway. Overall, a really cool product and a must have for iPod users that need to have an audio recording capability.",

Upon connection to your computer, iTunes will open and it will automatically transfer the voice files to your music library. The only downsides to this product are:1. The recorder has capability of turning \"autogain\" on. This picks up a significant amount of background noise. If you are recording a lecture, the presenter's voice will not be disrupted, but it is a bit annoying.2. 1 hour of lecture will suck almost 1/2 of your Nano's battery power. During days of 3 hour lectures, I have to sit close to an outlet so I can run the USB through my charging computer so the battery won't die.

I assumed that I hadn't charged the iPod fully, plugged it in during dinner and prepared for the next day. Sure enough, after less than 2 hours my battery was dead again. I went out during dinner and purchased an Olympus solid-state recorder which lasted the final 3 days on a single AAA battery, including recording all the evening sessions typically lasting into the wee hours of the morning.If you have short things to record, this is a nice option, but it's hard to justify when my Olympus recorder weighs LESS and lasts FAR longer with no hard drive noise.

After reading reiviews on various products and talking to friends about their experiences, this is the product I decided to purchase. Sound quality is great. The battery life varies depending on the ipod that you are attaching the recorder to. The only complaint I have is if you try to use the hold button on your ipod, the screen will freeze. The only way to get it to work again is to reboot the ipod or let the battery drain until it's completely dead. It took my third time using the product to realize the hold button was the source of the problem. Otherwise great product and I recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced recorder that is compact and easy to use.",

    "text": "This is actually the second Tune Talk I have purchased. I work at a university and part of my job is developing online courses. Podcasting is making an increasing presence in online courses and we are always looking for ways to simplify the process while providing a quality product. Quality voice recording is a challenge and the Tune Talk addresses that challenge very well. The device mounts easily to the bottom of an iPod and immediately configures for recording. The process is simple and intuitive. The recording is saved to the iPod and can be later synchronized with iTunes. Recordings are down as high quality stereo wave files - which can later be edited and/or compressed. Recording quality is excellent. Very clear and free of the hiss one often hears with inexpensive recording devices. Many others on campus use the device as well and all seemed pleased with the result. The term \"studio quality\" sometimes slips into descriptions. Were this device used in a sound proof environment I would cautiously use studio quality to describe the results. Definitely worth the money.",

I bought it to record live interviews and speeches, and download them to my PC. I tested it this weekend--it's small, and the recording is easy to use, and it' creates very exceptional sound quality. I'm impressed.It did cost more than I would like, but the sound is top notch. It's easy to use too.The box was huge given the tiny size of the product--marketing.It comes with this plastic stand that is very cheezy and cheap, to hold up the iPOD for recording angle when you are recording. Otherwise, the iPOD with this connected will just lay there, and speakers will be laying down facing the ceiling! You need this little plastic device, but it's really junky, and how long before it breaks is anyone's guess. I do really like the TunTalk recorder, and now I'll see how to download it to my PC!",

If you record on high quality, I had to make sure to have my ipod fully charged to get about an hour and 15 minutes of recording. Low quality roughly doubles the amount of recording time and the difference in quality between low and high isn't that much of a change.Overall great product!",

Sometimes the chunks are a couple words in a sentence, and sometimes they're a few sentences. I recorded my friend and I talking to test it and while listening to the track I'd be like \"Hey, it skipped that entire part about when you got that letter in the mail!\" and it was unacceptable. What if I'd been recording something very important? I figured when I put the track on my computer and listened to it that it'd be fine, but those chunks were still missing. Also, the chunks that are missing still count towards the total size and length of the track. I recorded something for 23 minutes (class lecture) and at least four minutes of audio is missing. Around the 19 minute mark, the track just concludes. It's really, really, really frustrating and now I see why it was marked down sixty percent. Oh, other than that, the sound quality is stupendous. So, if you like things that look neat, and actually are kinda neat, but are effectively *worthless*, this product is for you.",

It works best if you keep it a few feet away from you when recording so that you pick up both your singing and the instrumentation. I tried the iTalk and that one had kind of a popping noice when there was music. It was fine for talking but acted up when the piano started. So I took it back and bought this one.The only draw back is that I am not able to use it when I have a case on it. It would give me a message that there was no recoder hooked up, when there was.

So I guess I use it as an enabler for a pro lapel mic. It's a really convenient size too. I have used it by itself and it still seems okay although the distance from voice to recorder makes a difference - the further away the voice is, the recording level and quality drops off quite fast. That's where a mic that plugs into the TuneTalk is important for my use - if you want to record a presentation in a room it's okay but not ideal. Also, for some reason, I've had a couple just stop working after a while - I buy a new one to replace it, but I think it should last longer, and it's really inconvenient when it doesn&#8217;t give any advance indications, just doesn&#8217;t record suddenly.

    "text": "I bought this product to use with my 3rd gen iPod nano. Before buying it, I researched a lot of digital recorders. I listened to side-by-side comparisons, looked at prices and read more reviews than I'm comfortable admitting.I am a professional musician, and I was looking for an extremely lightweight, super-cheap alternative to DigiDesign and Tascam products. I did not need to duplicate the professional recording equipment I already have. I merely wanted something I could toss in my gig bag and bring to a live show or rehearsal to record a few songs and then email them as mp3s to my band or to other musicians I collaborate with. I also wanted to be able to record random songs whenever I heard them (or thought them up).In all these aspects, this little number performs beautifully. I would never use it for CD-quality recording. I wouldn't use it for two hours' worth of music (because it does tend to eat up battery life). But it's a hell of a lot cheaper than buying a dedicated digital recorder (especially if you've already got that kind of equipment at home). And it's really, really tiny, so you can carry it with you anywhere.There's no speaker, so you have to listen to playback using your earbuds, but so what? The stand is a piece of garbage, but I just lay my nano on a table and it works fine. And again, it eats battery life, so you won't get more than an hour's worth of music, if that. But for my needs, it's perfect.Hope this helps.",

I've also recorded stereo music at the iPod HIGH QUALITY setting(44,100Hz sample rate, 256,000bps bit rate, stereo) and the results are terrific too. I use audio editing software to convert the relatively large .WAV files that the iPod produces, to a smaller .MP3 format. I haven't needed the built-in stereo microphone yet, but that also checked out OK! One more thing...

If you are using a standard iPod video it uses the internal hard drive alot and the very sensitive mic picks up the sound of the spinning hard drive with great clarity. This makes for very annoying sound. So the external mic is only useful for taking short spoken notes for yourself. If you are using the nano this should not be a problem.The other problem is that with all that hard drive use, recording eats batteries fast. On my iPod video it can drain a fully charged battery in about 20 minutes. So if you want to use this for podcasting, get an external mic and something to charge it from an AC outlet while recording.",

Overall I am satisfied with the range of the TuneTalk. It will pick up voices from at least 20 feet away with a fair amount of clarity. Another positive is that you can attach the mini USB to the TuneTalk and run the Ipod off of a laptop or desktop computer.In terms of some drawbacks I find that the autogain feature can pick up small sounds. If you turn a page it will be picked up. Another drawback is file size. Generally speaking, a one hour constant recording will use about 300mb. Another drawback is that battery life is drained quickly. Recording for one hour will require a full battery.",

When used for a recording interrupted only by pauses (but not review or correction), the performance of the product is adequate. This reviewer has not tested the product for recording music. With the stereo microphone, this might be a strong point.5. For uninterrupted recording of a lecture or performance, if the microphone could be placed sufficiently close to the source, this might be a good choice for an inexpensive recording product.6. This product has been tested with a Mac. The iTunes interface is adequate. This product was chosen in part to give greater control over the sound files, and was disappointing in that regard.

I have had very good results recording various music rehearsals (children's choir to big band) with and without an external powered microphone (Sony ECM-MS908C stereo mic) attached. Since I already had the mic, the total cost was very low compared to purchasing something like a Zoom digital recorder for this type of recording. I haven't plugged it into a mixing board yet. I suspect it would produce an even better recording with a decent pair of mics through a Mackie 1202 or better.I bought a USB power adaptor so I wouldn't have to worry about battery drain. It plugs into the TuneTalk and provides power to the iPod.No, it isn't as good as a high dollar recorder, dedicated mic-pre's and a pair of Neumann mics. Serious recording requires serious equipment. However, for all those other recordings, the Tunetalk Stereo is a great recording option for about $60 and your trusty iPod.",

Kind of a piece of junk, really.I am amazed at the average of 4.5 out of 5 star reviews, and the positive media reviews. Either the product has improved significantly in the last eight or nine months, or, as has been my experience with most Apple products and peripherals, the standards that are applied are very low, and people have come to accept poor engineering due to good marketing. I hope others have a better experience with this product; unfortunately it is the only stereo recorder available, which is also remarkable given the popularity and (supposed) versatility of the iPod.",

    "text": "Hello,I wanted a digital voice recorder to record school lectures. However, I did not want to buy another doohickey to carry around and the prices on decent recorders were a bit high.I have an 80g Video 5G Ipod and noticed some good reviews of the Belkin Tunetalk product and decided to give it a try. The thing could not be easier to use. I took it out of the package, plugged it into the Ipod and it automatically launched the voice recording menu. All I had to do was touch the center button and it was off and recording. Hit the button again and it pauses. Select \"Stop and save\" and it does its thing.The autogain feature works very well as lecturers move around the room. The sound is crisp and clear on low quality and I don't miss a word. The only downside to the device is that it will pick up sounds from the hard drive during recording. Every so often, a few seconds of tapping can be heard. The tapping isn't as loud as the noise a particularly annoying classmate takes as she bangs on her laptop keyboard during lecture, but it is noticeable. If drive-noise free recording is desired, I would think an external microphone would take care of the issue nicely. I may explore this if I use it to record music.After recording, just sync the Ipod to your computer and you've got your lectures in your music library. I use the Itunes \"Get Info\" option to categorize the recordings by class, professor, or specific lecture material. I take the additional step of converting the wav files to mp3 and then re-syncing them, but this is no trouble at all.My Ipod is going on two years old, but I still get good recording time. I get around 2 and a half hours of recording on low quality before the battery indicator goes red. If I ever do run out of battery before I run out of drive space, the Tunetalk has a power port to allow further recording if you have or are near a power source.I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it.",

    "text": "I have used the TuneTalk with my video iPod for about 3 years.I manage a volunteer effort to record audio and video of high school concerts including concert band, orchestra, and choir. The overall goal is to feed archives, provide students a chance to self-critique, and to raise funds for the school music program through recording sales.We use the video iPod plus TuneTalk as a backup, recording analog stereo line-level output from our primary recorder through a distribution amp. Our approach is to turn it on roughly 10 minutes before the first downbeat, and turn it off at the end of the concert. It is basically a fire and forget approach.The iPod is powered through the TuneTalk power pass-through, from a Belkin power strip with USB power output.The complaints about intermittent recording are usually a result of recording on an iPod that is nearly full. In that condition, the iPod OS eventually chooses to defrag, and that defrag effort can disrupt recording.To avoid that defrag problem, we remove recordings from the video iPod after transfer to a computer for editing. Basically the iPod is never more than 50% full when we start recording. A reasonable estimate of iPod disk space needed is 1 GB per hour of recording.The recording sampling size and rate is CD quality to a lossless stereo WAV file.Aside from backing up our primary digital recorder, the iPod is also a convenient way to hand a copy to the teachers for use in class during the next school day.The distribution amp also feeds stereo audio at line level to a digital camcorder through roughly 80 feet of stereo cable. Occasionally that feed fails, and the iPod WAV file becomes the replacement audio track for the video DVD product.I do not use the built-in mics on the Tune Talk. So I cannot comment on those. Reports indicate that the mics pick up iPod disk motor noise.",

The quality of the recording is great. I did hear from other reviews saying that TuneTalk is so sensitive that you'll hear the harddrive spinning when you record thru the mic. IMO, if you record live... the mic will definitely pick up other sound too and you seriously won't use this mic to record something that you'll publish anyway...and, if no one told you about it... you wouldn't have noticed it! Besides, If you use the line-in option, you won't hear the harddrive spinning! I think the only minus is... you can't really listen the recording while it's being recorded.

This product works with the 2nd gen nano so you don't have to use the video iPod. This eliminates any hard disk noise. I have the 8 gB nano and it works flawlessly with this. The gain is adjustable between high and none. I found that the recordings of my piano playing clipped noticeably with the gain on so I just turned it off and it was fine. I am using it for recording my music lessons and my wife's voice lessons.I have some minor complaints about this product. The first is the very poor stand that comes with it. For me that is not a huge problem for recording since I have used it on a music stand. If I was in a meeting that would be more of a problem. The second is probably a function of using with my nano. The headphone jack is obscured by the microphone so anytime I want to listen to what was recorded it requires me to remove the mic. It also is a little tricky to use with a nano in a protective case because you have to really make sure the mic is plugged flush into the interface. Since you can't use the headphones with it while it is recording it is tough to tell if you are clipping the recording so a little clip indicator would be nice. Not a huge deal for me though. If I want a high quality recording I would just use other equipment I have.I really like the USB port attachment and the line in feature. That makes it easy to use high quality mics with a mic preamp if you want or other line out devices.",

Now, speaking as a person who didn't even know what an iPod was when my husband got one 2 years ago, this was pretty easy to use. You just plug it in at the bottom and push the button to record. Push again to stop recording and you automatically get prompted to save. The sound quality is wicked good. I had the machine sitting in the middle of a conference table and it was able to pick up all the voices around the table. The detriment to using a traditional tape recorder is that those things often pick up the white noise from its own motor running (and sometimes the sound of the vibration of its motor while sitting on top of the table) and the quality is thus compromised.I'm thrilled with this purchase.

More adjustments than I can get into, just know that you need to adjust both camera and video to take best quality photos. They are not the default settings. You might also note that, any time you zoom a pic or vid, you are greatly reducing its clarity. Other than that, adjust your images to 2 megapixels and your photos will be quite large and quite clear. I'm one of those w/whom the difference between HDTV and a good TV is almost unrecognizable. I like a nice, crisp photos... I don't study them. GREAT camera... great video.Music, videos and photos may be downloaded via bluetooth or a USB cable which is provided.Now on to the Net. This is where the rubber meets the road for me as I don't really use portable music players. Right off the bat, I downloaded Opera's Mini Browser. It's far more robust than the factory installed. I was able to go to Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo mail and many other sites as well. The KRZR also comes loaded w/ Y! Messenger & AIM. Good stuff. This phone does NOT have an email client.I'm a smartphone owner (Nokia 6600), so I'm used to an email client for a couple of accounts and being able to use Opera Mobile which allows one to attach files and send messages, open multiple windows, store passwords and bookmarks, download mp3s as well as access nearly any website. Unfortunately, sick American corporations have determined that since we will pay an extra $20-30/month for PDA service (basically the same phone w/ a QWERTY keyboard), why offer more affordable smarthphones. THANKS TO AMAZON you may still purchase smartphones, but usually w/o the discount attached to a service plan.As for reception, this has as much to do w/ locale as phone and service operator. T-Mobile is a GSM carrier which means you may use your phone all over the globe. It also means you may text overseas & you have a SIM card to transport your phone book and account easily to any other GSM phone you may have or purchase. If you purchase an unlocked GSM phone in Timbuktu, you may insert your card and go. Not so w/ Sprint & Verizon. Ya gotta go through daddy. At one time TDMA/CDMA services (Sprint & Verizon) had better tracking, but GSM (T-Mobile & AT&T;) has caught up. T-Mobile has excellent reception and tracking... at least in the places I've been to & my phone worked in Europe w/ ease.I always thought of Motorolas as cheap and the RAZR as gimmicky. Moto's interface is a bit dated and could be a tad more intuitive, but the KRZR seems to be of good quality so far.As for Wirefly, well, I'm no fan of the company. One worker had the nerve to ask for my credit card info. Nice try, but I don't use my credit card twice for the same purchase. What the fffff.....!Overall, The KRZR K1 is decidedly an upscale unit. It has USB, bluetooth, stereo bluetooth, 2 megapixel camera, Opera Mini, memory card, records 3+minute videos, will hold numerous songs, works overseas, has excellent sound, a bright screen and sexy looks to boot. HOT and HAUGHT! It's a wonderful phone - more for the Dolce & Gabbana type than the 'down and dirty' type.",

    "text": "This phone was designed very poorly. From a cosmetic standpoint, it has a mirrored finish that is constantly smudged with fingerprints. After a week of carrying my phone in my front pocket, the mirrored surface cracked. The phone still works, but now I get to look at a cracked surface for the next two years while I work off the new service plan with T-mobile I'm locked into. Another problem with the display on the phone while it's closed is that it's hard to see the time and date. The buttons on the side of the phone are too recessed to be easily pushed to prompt the time to light up.The set up menus aren't very straight forward on this phone either. They've tried to make it very flexible, and in some instances that just confuses matters.There is this 20 second backlight that blacks out the screen every 20 seconds. Like me, I'm sure you're saying \"you can turn that off...\" But, I certainly can't find it, nor can the service people at Tmobile. So, when I'm trying to get into my Yahoo mail, which takes forever and multiple key strokes, the screen will go black while waiting for the web browser to launch. When you hit a key to make the screen come back on, if that key corresponds to an actual command on the (now black) screen, it'll still activate what ever the command is. So, while the screen lights up again, it's now trying to do some command that you don't want, so you have to back up and try again... I'm sure that there are \"safe\" keys that I will eventually find that will wake up the phone without activating a command, but I should have to do this. Like with any screen saver, a keystroke should just wake up the screen and not actually \"do\" anything.Another problem with the phone is the key pad. The \"up, down, left, right\" arrows are very hard to hit without hitting a key next to them. So, once again, I spend my time reversing commands that I inadvertently hit along the way. I used to have a very simple Samsung phone with Sprint and I never thought I'd miss that antiquated guy, but I do...Sound quality is average at best. Not sure if that's the phone's fault, Tmobile, or my area of coverage...Good luck if you but this phone model. The K-RAZR is a step down from the RAZR, not an improved version.",

It survived a complete soaking while I was caught in a rain storm with the phone in the pocket of my cycling jersey. I liked the small size a lot.The software on the phone, however, is complete garbage. I don't know how it is that Motorola sells so many of these (and it's older brother, the RAZR). The menus are slow and unresponsive. Setting the alarm takes - at minimum - 7 clicks (with lag in between). That's assuming you are simply enabling an alarm you had already set up. If not, prepare for another 5-10 clicks. Alarms may not be an important feature to you (or to me really), but you can expect a continuation of this maddening user experience in all other areas.

There are so many weird one-time occurances that it would be impossible to list. Bottom line, this phone is worthless. Don't even get it for free.On the plus side, though, it makes a good alarm!",

I would advise anyone who is thinking of purchasing this phone to go to a store and make a call from it first.The menu system is probably fine if you are used to motorola's but it seems quirky and nonituative compared to the sony ericson series. Just the mechanics of sending a text message require you to go through more steps and button presses than the Sony's -- again people that are used to motorola probably don't care, but it doesn't have to be as tedious as it seems.There also does not seem to be anyway to bulk load contacts via bluetooth from another device (0nly one at a time) -- you have to buy additional software at extra cost and do the bulk transfer from your PC.If you load additional network applications such as opera, there is no default option to allow the application to always use the internet -- you have to give the app permission every time you run it unless you want to hack the phone internally.On a more positive note the phone looks cute and camera is better than I expected.

I have had mine for over three years and the only reason I need to buy another is because the connection finally failed (too loose). The only reason my wife needed another unit in the same amount of time was because the fitted earpiece she selected (you get three sizes for each ear)got lost and it was almost as inexpensive to get an entirely new unit rather than just getting replacement eargels. I have had NO problems with bending the wire as other reviews state. I actually keep the entire unit in an old, hardshell eyeglass case and it keeps it all intact and all the pices stay together.This is the ONLY microphone I've ever had that other callers could hear me clearly and I could hear them clearly.

It is a very nice phone, with many features, and advanced options, yet it just leaves to much to be desired, in my opinion. Firstly, the voice quality that other people hear when i call them is awful. I think the microphone is on the front of the phone, ie that part that touches your face when you hold it at a natural angle. However, the quality has degraded as time has passed. Another problem is that the OS is very slow, and occasionaly requires a reboot. The battery life is iffy, and occasionally, just drops to almost nothing for no reason. Another problem i face is that it drops calls when i dial out of my phone book ~50% of the time. It is like it forgets that i asked it to call, but appears in the call log. And finally, the swivel design. I loved it, and originally bought it in part b/c i like the design a lot, but it is a pain. It takes some skill to do while driving or with one hand. Not bad, but i would like people to be able to hear my over the phone.",

I admit I've gotten bored as you usually do with 'toys', but this phone is quality as well. The speakerphone is excellent. The charge seems to last forever. The games are similar to a PS2 quality, if not basically the same (visually that is). It has Memory Stick Duo which can hold MP3's, pictures and whatever else. This phone also has BLUETOOTH technology and infrared, which stunned me one day at Staples when I sent a picture on my phone to a PDA on display in the store. And it was free. It is easy to use and there are so many options with this phone. It has EDGE and GSM data communication. It does everything. The screen is gigantic and has the best of any phone I have seen. This phone might be a little outdated (who cares) but I like it. The only issue is the fact that it's really large....but that doesn't bother me. It has everything. Record movie clips, pictures...sound recording, media maker, all kinds of things you can do to amuse yourself.If you're looking to purchase a cell phone and you're pricing digital cameras as well, I'd go for this and save money. The 1.3 MP camera isn't the best you can get---(I'd go for Sony's 7.3 Cybershot or my personal favorite the Sony Cybershot W5)...but this phone will do everything you could want...and more than you need probably...probably way more than you need.",

The newest of their phones through Cingular at the time was the S710a, so this phone seemed like a no-brainer.The amazing Sony Ericsson user interface and address book had remained unchanged, except for their newly added strengths and reduced weaknesses. The Bluetooth was as fully-featured as ever, working perectly with my Mac computer and Parrot handsfree car kit. Reception was excellent, even in some of our \"thin\" coverage areas here. I heartily welcomed EDGE as well as MP3 ringtones, both absent from the T616. The earpiece and speakerphone each delivered clear, loud sound. The display simply stunned me with its brilliance.After a few months of use, the above positives were overwhelmed by the negatives. First, there are its physical flaws. The phone lacks the solid, tactile of Motorola phones; though heavy, the S710a feels cheap. This is a heavy phone, though, and extremely large, too",

And believe me, Razor does not even come close to this phone, its sleek thats it, and ofcourse, most motorolas are pieces of junk.Everyone say this phone is expensive and big and bulky, ppl please see what the bloody thing is packing!!! The camera quality is amazing, the best I've seen so far and believe me I've seen quite a bit, even better that Nokia's 1.3. The only better thing might be the z800(if I am not wrong) which packs a better camera.The Swivel action is so cool. But let me get this clear, it's \"technically\" 360 degrees rotational, but practically only 180. You can close ONLY the way you opened it, but i guess it helps to keep screws from loosening or something.The screen, OMG, its beautiful, the clarity is amazing, and its huge. Please take care of it, its too vulnerable to scratches, get PDA protectors or something,Fully functional MP3 player, its kinda boo that only 128 megs can be put in, but i can get like 6 128 mb cards for less than 30 bucks. But yeah lack of PRO support pisses me off. Most ppl think you cant do anything on the phone when the MP3 player is ON. but you can minimize your player and get on with your other stuff.The clarity is not like any cheap player, its almost as good as an iPod, the headset provided is decent, but the sad thing is you cant put in your own headphones, you'll have to use a sony's only.I think they renewed the firmware or something, so the UI is not as slow as people say it is.The reception is awesome, you wont know how good it is until you use it.So yeah, want advice? buy it",

You can only use Cingular's WAP portal or add a bookmark.- The shutter sound cannot be turned off.- It doesn't have the Symbian OS.- It's bulky.- No MS Pro support so you only get up to 128mb external.- After delaying the release for 6 weeks, Cingular decided to raise the price to $450 with a 2 year contract.So perhaps the s710a hasnt lived up to the hype. Right now this phone is not worth the cost, but hopefully they can fix some of these issues with updated firmware. If they can speed up the UI, fix the WAP URL bug, disable the shutter sounds, and lower the cost back to its original price, this phone would get 5 stars. Many of these technical issues were already fixed once for the S700i, so why they werent fixed for the S710a is disappointing.",

All of the extras they've packed in are really enjoyable but I had three main issues that were enough to make me give it up:1) I had awful call quality. Every person that I talked to said it was like I was inside of a barrel, but it got better when I used the phone's provided earbud. The phone's shape is more like a camera than a cell phone which made it almost impossible to hold in so that your ear was comfortably over the speaker. I knew that the phone wasn't worth the $300 I'd spent for it when I tried to call customer support from my office and the representative said \"I'm sorry but you're cutting out\".2) The internet would never work. I would call support and it would work for 15 minutes after I talked to them, but after that it would stop. It might have been a problem with my area, but every time it happened they would have me shut off my phone so they could upgrade it.3) The menu is so slow. The phone has to think about everything, and when you try to imbed pictures in an e-mail or multimedia message, it takes even longer.Other than those three main problems, here are the other pros and cons I noticed:Pros:- Included accessories. It came with a flash card, card reader, software for the reader, and an earbud, all of which functioned very well.- The screen. Enough said.

    "text": "I've been using my S710 for about a week now and thus far I have been tremendously impressed.The clarity, brightness and color saturation of this superbly large display makes this phone really shine for people like myself who have vision problems and hate squinting at the little LCD or small color displays on most phones.The camera takes excellent pictures for a cell phone digicam and is extremely easy to use. The user interface around zooming, cropping, manipulating and mailing pictures to others is excellent as well.Another stand out feature is a really impressive array of Bluetooth profiles supported, and done right. If you have a Mac you will be pleasantly surprised at how seamless things like file transfer, remote browsing and ICal/Addressbook sync with ISync are. Being able to update the phone's address book from the Mac with a single button press is a joy.This phone is one of the first with a big enough display and a solid enough J2ME implementation to make using sophisticated J2ME apps entirely palatable.The only cons are very minor and actually quite understandable - I'm not sure how they could have been done any different. First, battery drain is fairly quick compared to phones with smaller displays, however it's not voracious or unusable by any stretch - just keep an eye on things and charge early and often and you should be fine. Also, the camera piece can be somewhat awkward to hold steady, but again being an amalgamation of camera and phone I'm entirely unsure as to how this could be improved upon.Overall I love this phone, and would recommend it to anyone needing something more capable than the average flip phone.",

I've had the phone for 2 weeks already and I love it.The graphics on this cell are awesome, the menu is gorgeous and the phone design is really cool.The camera quality is decent, NOT great, however I still havent a seen a cellphone that makes perfect pictures. It can also record video but the image gets distorted rather quickly by fast movements.The menu also lags whenever you press a button, but I feel is a small price to pay given the high graphics. The battery doesnt really last that much either. On average, between playing with the camera, talking, and playing games on it I get about 2 hours worth of talk time spread out in 2 days.",

The phone will lock up for up to 20 seconds, and then finally release...performing the 3 or 4 functions you pressed while it was frozen. Its unresponsive for a $400 phone. Secondly, sound quality on the phone is fine if you get the microphone in just the right spot, but if you try to cradle the phone in your shoulder and talk, no one will be able to hear you.

    "text": "First of all, I want to let you know that this phone has been EVERYWHERE with me, I've had it for 3 years. Here's why:1) This phone has everything you need, from writing e-mails to making videos. I can easily stay on track with work e-mails without walking around with a gigantic blackberry. Writing e-mails is a snap, no extra fee's are required. The camera has a 1.3 MP camera with a light (not just a flash) that is rival to the luxor in Las Vegas. With one button you can switch to video mode, and choose where you want to save the vids/pics. This phone also has AIM...awesome. Many games were made for this phone by now and are easily transferable to the phone using bluetooth from your computer (why get online with the phone and mess around with WAP?). Some programs for your computer even alow you to text, call, write notes, etc. through your computer. It's fun and free. The bluetooth technology on this phone is great. There's countless sites to download free games, free themes, apps, etc. This phone has it all, calenders, stopwatch, alarms, mp3 player, video player, music DJ, and countless software to download and use, like a metric converter, first aid guide, and yahoo IM. You can hook up headphones to this thing and rock your way around the streets without having a mas puto bluetooth hanging off your ear. There is also a lock switch that's very unique. It's not an eye sore, you don't have to press buttons to unlock it, all you do is slide the spring-retention switch and you're ready for use. This is much better than most phones because there's NO WAY to accidently call, get online, etc. while it's in your pocket, bag, or car. It's MUCH better than the lock switch on the PSP (which is the SAME switch for the power, dumb).2) The durability is phenominal. Through the years I've dropped it in a lake in Alaska, threw it at little brothers, used it as an alarm clock in Kenya, Africa, transfered files with people in Europe, and used it as an mp3 player while serving in the Middle East. Sunlight has no effect on this thing and you can leave it in a freezer and still have it work for you.3) Customize. You can create shortcuts left an right. I push one button and I'm texting buddies. You open the lens cover (how many phones have THAT?) and you're in camera mode, press right and you're in mp3 mode, it's features are countless. I change themes all the time and this phone works just as great as it did when I bought it in 2004.4) Accessories. This comes with a memory card slot wich is very usefull, internal media memory of 32MB to get you started, a brilliant screen that still pops eyes. The swivel design is creative and helpfull when playing games (ambidex.). So far, nothing has jammed, got deleted automatically, failed to operate randomly, and if all this still doesn't make you think about getting this 3 year- going on 4 year-old phone, ask yourself this",

All my friends and family members use Cingular so a two-year contract doesn't really bother me. I payed $300 and will recieve a $100 via mail-in rebate. The price was on point considering my old phone, a Motorola V300, cost me $250 and didn't have half the features of this phone.This phone is not perfect though. Off the bat I noticed that the UI was unresponsive at times. It's pretty annoying but it's acceptable. Another gripe I have is with Sony about it's proprietary storage medium. I have a PSP and recently purchased a 512 MB Memory Stick PRO Duo. I thought, because they are the same form factor, that I could interchange the PRO Duo with the Duo used in the S710a but no. I'm relagated to 128 MB maximum storage capacity so the mp3 functionality of the phone, for me, has been reduced. All the other features",

I push menu and most of the time it takes 5-10 seconds for the menu to come up. Sometimes (but very rarely) it's instantly.- Bad picture quality in dark environments (but it's not a real digital camera, so you can't expect it to be).- You cannot turn speakerphone on until you are already in the call. It just bothers me that I have to wait for someone to answer before I can turn speakerphone on).- Some software problems (especially the Notes program).- Menu icons occasionally disappear.- A number of dropped calls (I hate that).- People cannot hear me but I can hear them.- I press call and sometimes it just will not call.I originally gave this phone 3 stars, but while I was listing the cons, I realized how many problems it has, and that it only deserves 2 stars.

At 1.3 megapixels the quality is good enough for most daiy uses. It's not a replacement for a high end digital camera though. The video shooting capability is interesting but I haven't had much need for it other than a novelty item.Transfering pictures to your computer is a little convaluted with a hardware adapter. I figure Bluetooth is a much better way to do this and it does support it. I just haven't made the time to do it, so that isn't the phone's fault so much as my not being a complete techno-hound on how to do it.I like being able to download e-mail when I can't get to a computer.

The swiveling action is very neat and fun. I also love the camera, which is surprisingly good for a phone, and looks like a real digital camera when you are holding it. I would highly reccomend this phone, especially if you love gadgets. I was planning on buying one for Christmas from Amazon, but for some reason, they raised the price of this phone from $100 to $200. Looks like I will be buying it from somewhere else if the price doesn't go back down.",

    "text": "Great camera, great display but then it goes wrong on stupid things. It does not put a dash in phone numbers, just jams them together. Nice large font for numbers, but of course they messed it up with the style font. Tall skinny numbers, 0,8,6 9 all look the same because horizontal part of number is super thin. Then of course no talk/bye buttons. To hang up, press a round key. Unfortunately sometimes the processor slows and it does not respond to the button. If you push it again and the processor catches up, that button becomes the key to turn off the ringer. Then you go all day wondering why people are not calling. The software you can download from Sony to link phone to PC for file management and MP3 is cranky and mostly useless. The number keys are flat and impossible to use by feel. Then of course when you want to review call history, they are not in any order. I would expect them to be sorted by time with most recent first. The preloaded ringtones are garbage also. One is a chicken clucking, another is hip/hop \"hey your phone is ringing\" It also has trouble with any signal less than all bars, starts dropping in and out and then quits all together. The data plug and charger plugs are a real disaster. You must be in good lighting and look closely to get the plug lined up correctly. To disconnect, you have to pull hard, dont think this fragile plug will last long. The volume when up all the way is barely adequate in high noise areas. The external speaker is tinny, have heard much better sound in a $19 phone. Finally, voice command is primitive, can only do contact voice tags. I am used to an Audiovox that if it doesn't understand a command, will talk to you and offer suggestions. There is no voice digit dialing either. There is no way to lengthen the time the display stays on. It uses a custom plug for mic/earphone, no way to get a more useful headset other than the little earbud type without going to bluetooth. Battery life is unexpected. It will be showing full charge and then an hour later it is almost dead, and I had not used it. Guess when it cranks up the power in a weak area it sucks hard on the battery. Othertimes I can talk for an hour without putting a dent in the battery indicator. Overall it is just an overpriced 1.3 mpix camera/MP3 player with a shoddy phone attached. Sony had to spend big $$ developing this high tech phone and no one ever tried using it real-world before they went to manufacturing. Any of these shortfalls could have easily been corrected.",

    "text": "So I've read many reviews, done the research and here is what I came up with, I'll give it to you honestly.I moved from T-mobile to cingular. I broke my sidekick 2 and i was looking for something very *unbreakable* as well as functional.First, I got the motorola ROKR e1.I really liked it, everything worked fine, though when i text messaged it gave me some problems because the buttons were close togather. Also don't get that phone unless you get a case, becuase in your pocket (without the key lock on) it's a pain.So then I returned it and got this phone, the amazing, and ever reliable sony s710a.Motorola has got very easy menu's and very good layout. But this phone takes the cake. The sony has everything to it, mp3s, speaker phone, VERY IMPRESSIVE camera (even with motion it's good) and many have complained about the nighttime funcionality but I think it's still better than the rokr. The price tag is definantly a hefty fee, but it is SO completely worth the 299 I paid for it.The menu does live up to be a bit slow when you turn the phone off and start it out. And the battery didn't last very long for the first 2 days. After that, the battery life turns out to be good.Now, for the people who drop their phones. I've dropped the poor thing twice now, and have a scratch on near the buttons at the bottom of the screen. I'm not suggesting that your drop the phone on purpose, but actually since I've dropped it the battery life has been much better, and the phone seems to function better than when i got it (funny enough eh?) This thing is infinantly durable, and when you open the phone it makes a very solid click. Sony is really top quality, I get better reception even with the moto rokr, and that right there is impressive. The phone has good quality speaker phone, and the pictures really are amazing.Funny enough, when i got the phone a young guy was in the cingular store and was returning his s710a. I asked him why, right before I got the phone just to see if I should buy it. He said he kept having problems with the keyboard and speaker phone. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT! Texting is easy, EVEN IN THE CAR, despite the flat buttons when you flip the phone.Overall, I really think this phone is perfect and I don't even use the many features that it has, but it has impressed me beyond belief. Check out the consumer photos they took with it to see just how WONDERFUL the camera is. The battery life does go down a margine when you use the digital camera replacing 1.3 megapixel camera. But it's not that bad. Just charge your phone when you go to sleep, and you will be very please with the performance. IT IS WORTH THE PRICE!",

    "text": "I was a sprint customer for over 4 years and got sick of the lack of decent devices that stand out from the crowd (not the only reason I quit Sprint, but that's a story for another day!). I'm a big proponent of standing out. The s710a does just that. It stands out. During my search for replacement phones, I looked at the s710a, the motorola a630 and a couple of others. Bluetooth was a requirement. I chose the s710a because of it's unique swivel action and expandable memory. Granted, according to most people, you can only put in 128MB, I haven't tested that yet. Even then, being able to load a few mp3s to listen to while walking to work makes a difference to me.I like the s710a and don't have any issues with the size. I also love the slide-lock which locks the device while it's in my jeans pocket. The screen is excellent and it's wonderful how, even though it's in my jeans pocket all the time, I haven't been able to scratch it. I've left my phone unplugged for over 4 days with a couple of long calls and text messages each day, so no complaints with the battery life. Unlike Verizon phones, this phone has full bluetooth capabilities - none are crippled. Fit and finish are great - the phone feels solid, is of good quality. Rare nowadays. Most of the time, the phone can be used without opening it up. The buttons below the screen can be used in almost all cases unless you need to punch in any numbers. The swivel action feels solid and the phone doesn't feel flimsy when opened.Reception is great. I use a motorola v180 from Cingular at work and in the basement where my office is, the s710a will have 2-3 bars when the v180 reports no service or 1 bar.The software seems a little sluggish to respond and could be a little more intuitive but there wasn't much of a learning curve. The keypad buttons do feel a little too flush though, I've not really had any issues per se. The speakerphone volume could be a little louder and so could the earpiece. The power connector could be a little easier to deal with - you need two hands to plug the device in. The camera will not replace a dedicated digital camera but it's pretty decent and easy to use for on-the-spur snapshots and video. It would also be nice to be able to turn on the speakerphone before dialing out and not just during a call - unless I'm missing something and haven't read the manual properly.Again, no major issues, just possible enhancements. I don't like the fact that it's locked to Cingular but so far, I've not had any issues with their service and I definitely appreciate the device support that's available on their site. It's because of these minor issues that I didn't give the phone a 5-star rating.I would recommend this phone to gadget lovers and people who don't mind getting looks for having a unique phone!",

    "text": "My #1 complaint with the Sony Ericsson S710a would be some of the reviewers. One reviewer stated something like, \" it was annoying having to open the S710a to take a picture\", guess they didn't read the manual. Someone stated, \"small keys\", I have big hands and had no problem with the recessed keys. This was a good one, \"the hands free ear piece was to loud\" well there's volume control buttons. By the way they never mentioned the little chrome button on the mouthpiece of the hands free that you press to answer or press to hang-up.I have also heard complaints about the swivel opening of the S710a. I do feel this swivel style is much stronger than a hinged flip style since there is a much larger bearing surface allowing less of a chance of cracked and broken hinges as I've seen on other hinged portable equipment.Although I haven't checked battery talk time I know I get at least 4 hours and it takes about 1 hours to recharge.I don't consider the S710a big and bulky for what it has and that is an excellent camera. Without reading the camera instructions I found it easy to use to take pics of my daughter in her Halloween costume.I was pleasantly surprised to find I could read the display and number buttons without glasses. The display is bright and sharp, as a matter of fact at times I use the brightness of the display as a flashlight at night walking on my unlit driveway (there is also a camera light).Sound quality is crisp and clear even when Cingular reception isn't the best. If you don't want to hold the phone next to your ear the speakerphone has excellent clarity.All I wanted was a good phone and I got a lot more. I bought a second for my daughter's mother so she can capture all those things I taught my daughter to annoy Mommy, Auntie P and Grandma..",

Buttons are a bit strange, but nothing one can't get used to. The operating system is typical Sony Ericsson. It does sync with Mac OS X, though you have to pair from the device to computer first. Then you have to pair from the computer to the device. iSync then recognizes the phone.The camera is pretty good, though not great. It a a big improvement over previous Sony Ericsson phones. Resolution is about 1280 x 960. There is a \"flash\"; really it is a light, but it works well. The camera has spot metering, rapid capture, movie capture, multiple resolution settings, etc. Great for blogging and quick snapshots that you may want to print out. Obviously this is not a replacement for a better, higher MP, digital camera.The MP3 player is very good, though simplistic. It lists all songs on the memory card then all MP3s on the phone itself. I will that it would exclude MP3 ringtones, but it does not. Fortunately, it plays the songs on the memory card first... then it plays MP3s (ringtones) on the phone.In all, it is a very good phone. The games one can buy are better than ones on the 610/616. I give it 4 stars just for capabilities and simplicity. I took one star away because the MP3 player seems too simplistic.",

    "text": "After having my eye over this phone for over a year and trying to justify spending over $200 for a cell phone. I decided to take the plunge and get this phone.I refused to pay full retail price and eventhough I have been pretty satisfied with Cingular's service, I did not want to be forced into a contract just to get this phone at a discounted price. By the time I got this phone, Cingular no longer offered it anyway, so I got this phone pratically new from Ebay for $240 including shipping.Out of curiousity I even checked Sony's website to see if it was indeed limited to certain zipcodes as another reviewer suggested, and he/she was correct. It was not \"available\" in my zipcode either which is pretty stupid, if someone is willing to pay for a phone, they should be able to buy it regardless of where they live. If it wasn't for Ebay, then I wouldn't have been able to get this phone regardless of how much I was willing to pay for it.The first thing that intrigued me about this phone is the nice big screen and the swivel design. I do not like flip phones very much, and I also wanted something that differed from the regular phones. The S710a was the clear choice.After first picking up the phone, I noticed the size and weight of it. Its pretty big and heavy compared to many phones out there, but that is the way I like it. I am tired of all these cheaply built tiny phones that have no weight or size to them.Phone features are numerous, the main things are a 1.3 MegaPixel digital camera which is suprisingly good; much better than my old T637. The picture quality look very good on the phone as well, and it also came with a device that allows you to transfer your pictures and songs to and from a PC.And also a pretty darn good MP3 player as well. It sounds OK when playing it out of the phone, but attach earphones, and it sounds VERY good, it even has a graphic equalizer. The phone can only accept non-PRO Sony memory sticks. (This is in the manual BTW). The largest memory stick I have found that is not PRO is 128MB, so that is limited. However add this 128 to the 32MB internal memory thats 160 MB of space which can hold about 30 - 40 songs. That is plenty for me, if you want more, then you will probably need to get an IPOD or a phone that supports PRO DUO, (up to 1GB of space). I did not get this phone solely for the MP3 player, but since it has that feature I will use it.Another good thing about the phone is that any MP3 you store can be set as a ringtone. Why download ringtones for $2.49 for a snippet of the song, when you can use your own MP3's as ringtones for free? Again ringtones are not something I am into and I certainly won't pay for them, but with me being able to use my own MP3's as ringtones for free I will use it.Included in the phone's software is a media player that can be used to play your MP3 and video files. However, the file types it can recognize is limited to MP3, MP4, 3GP and WAV. You can also view steaming videos and music from the Web, but I probably will not use that feature.Other features are a sound recorder, speaker phone option, and of course internet, and text messaging.Another feature that use often is the bluetooth. My car is equipped with bluetooth so I can make and receive calls from my steering wheel and talk to them using the in car microphone and the center channel speaker. The phone can be anywhere in the car for this feature to work. I also found hte bluetooth handy when I wsa transferring my files from my old T637 into this phone. It was very easy to figure out.If that wasn't enough it also has infared technology as well; another way to transfer files back and forth.As far as the sony Memory stick goes, the phone does not support Memory stick PRO DUO, and the largest memory stick I have seen that is not PRO is 128MB, but I have not been able to find any non PRO memory stick in the retail stores, so I suppose I will have to get a larger one from Ebay.The phone does come with 32MB internal memory and a 32MB sony memory stick so right out of the box it has 64 MB. Purchase a 128MB stick and you will have 160MB, which will be more than enough for me, and most people I suspect.I have never been super impressed or excessively excited over a phone before but after seing this one, I knew I had to have it. I want and expect this phone to last me for a LONG time. I even purchased some screen protectors to protect the screen from scratches, something I never done with any cell phone I have had in the past.Given the choice, I would again choose this phone over the Razr and any other current phone cingular offers. I was never impressed with the Razr at all, and $500 retail (With a 2yr contract!) when it first came out was downright ridiculous. Now the Razr can be had for under $200, but still I would pay more and get the s710a instead.",

I have a Sony PC, laptop, video camera and MD player. My data completely flows now! With bluetooth, I already swapped data with a friend using an LG phone on Verizon; so there is nothing proprietary about the Sony phone.The camera is excellent considering the all in one functionality and the light on it is really bright. You could technically say it has a built-in flashlight!Battery life is great. After the initial charge, and learning all the buttons/menus/etc, taking pictures, videos and jammin' to mp3's the better part of the evening and all the following day, there is still a 3rd of the power bar left!The menu setup is very easy. I had all the functionality memorized by the end of the day. This phone has you covered in case your learning curve is longer. Anything that has a more involved selection, it will give you an \"info\" option for more details.I can rave about every other function of this awesome gadget, just waiting until end-of-contract to activate phone service. This is what I have been looking for since \"convergence devices\" hit the market.",

Then the indicator that says the battery is charging stopped showing that it was charging, but was still charging. After that, it just stopped charging completely and the red illuminator light that showed something was plugged in stopped and the phone died.Sent to Cingular for warranty, however I realized that I left the Sony Memory Stick in which they claim they cannot send me back anymore so there is $30 dollars lost!Overall, minus the phone dying and the bulkiness of it, it was a good phone.

The phone has megapixel technology with about 8x zoom. The reception is very good and I am always at five bars. Like other websites I do agree that the buttons are a bit slippery and a bit small but that's no a big setback. The battery life is okay and usually about 2-5 hours on a normal day.

Nice to have it for security, accident reporting, help, if you have to cancel pick-pocketed credit cards, if you make/confirm reservations, call the airline, be reached by the airline when flights change, or to call home/office or have them call you. Foreign phones can be very confusing, can cost lots of money to figure out how to use them, and one has to buy phone cards at a tobacco shop when they and their hours may not be convenient.I recommend 2 phones (one for your traveling companion) in case one phone gets stolen or dropped. Even if you never use it, it is there if you need it. I personally hate the constant use of cell phones by those around me, chit-chatting for no reason, but it is wise to have one when traveling just in case. Excellent product, SIM, shipping, and quality; you get all you need with it, including international charger.",

I agree with the other review here that says it isn't very grippy. His suggestion of adding a rubber foot is a very good solution, as it tends to slide around tables too easily.As a note, I already had an Invisible Shield on my phone when I put this case on. The Shield is pretty thin but it still prevents the case from comfortably snapping into place on the phone. It is a small peeve, as the front panel especially does not snap in (though the case still manages to stay on during normal use).Overall the best case compared to the alternatives when considering size, weight, cost, and protection.",

I was worried at first because it lacked the buttons on the iPod end and it looked very similar to the piece of crap I bought for $2. Plus when I first tried it, nothing happened. If this happens to you, try removing the power cord or battery from you PC or laptop and trying the cord after restoring power to your computer.What is really, really impressive is that before I figured out the problem I contacted iPhonesiSell and Jason immediately shipped me another cord after trying it out on his own iPhone and iPod.
